A con man going by the assumed name Harold Hill has used several different schemes to bilk the unsuspecting, and now travels from town to town pretending to be a professor of music - from the Gary (Indiana) Conservatory of Music, class of '05 - who solves all the respective towns' youth problems by forming boys' marching bands. He takes money from the townsfolk to buy instruments, music, instructional materials, and uniforms for their sons. However, in reality, he has no degree and knows nothing about music, and after all the materials arrive and are distributed, he absconds with all the money, never to be seen again. Many of the traveling salesmen in the territory have been negatively impacted by him, as the townsfolk then become suspicious of any stranger trying to sell them something. For Harold's scheme to work, he must gain the trust of the local music teacher, usually by wooing her, regardless of her appearance. And if the town doesn't believe it has a youth problem needing to be fixed, he will manufacture one for them. That is the case when he arrives in River City, Iowa, population 2,212, where he will have some unexpected help from Marcellus Washburn, a friend and former grifter colleague who now lives in River City and has gone straight, but he still wants to make sure Harold survives his stay in town. River City's music teacher is spinster and town librarian Marian Paroo. He's able to impress all the other River Citizens with his fast-talking sales pitches, but not suspicious Marian, whose hard-as-nails exterior is unlike all the other River Citizens. Her exterior is partly due to her somewhat removed standing in the town, as all the gossipy housewives believe she is a smut peddler - encouraging the teenagers to read authors such as Chaucer and Balzac - and mistakenly believe that she got her position as librarian through less-than-scrupulous means. What Harold does not know is that one way to Marian is through her young adolescent brother, Winthrop Paroo, a sullen boy who has withdrawn from life since their father's death two years before, when he started to lisp. Harold starts to fall for Marian, something that never happened with any of the other music teachers.

Although at that time, several of the current cast members were only children, more murders follow before Miss Marple ultimately exposes the killer.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0058383\/","Opening Date":"12\/9\/65","Closing Date":"12\/15\/65","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1965.0,"Title":"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians","IMDb Title":"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians","IMDb Year":"1964","Director":"Nicholas Webster","Cast":"John Call, Leonard Hicks, Vincent Beck, Bill McCutcheon","Country":"United States, Denmark","Certification":"Australia:PG, Canada:G::(Manitoba\/Quebec), Canada:PG::(Ontario), Canada:PG::(Nova Scotia), Finland:K-18::(self applied), United Kingdom:U::(video rating), United Kingdom:Uc::(video), United States:Not Rated, United States:Unrated","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","Runtime":"81","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMzZiNDM3MDgtM2VhOS00NWFiLTkyYzEtNjUwODQ0OTc4NzNiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Worried that their children have become obsessed with television shows from Earth which extol the virtues of Santa Claus, Martians begin an expedition to Earth to kidnap the one and only Santa Claus.

The five male witnesses rush off to the injured driver, their attention shifting away from his well-being when, just before passing, he gasps out that he has buried $350,000 in Santa Rosita State Park underneath a big W. When questioned by the attending police and asked directly if the victim said anything to them before he died, they all lie. In the eight ultimately discussing the issue among themselves and unable to come up with a way to divide the money that is acceptable to all if they work together to try to find it--by the five who attended, by all eight, by vehicle, by family unit, or a combination of any or all of the above--it becomes every person for him\/herself as they all rush to Santa Rosita State Park generally by vehicle unit to locate the big W and the money. That race isn't as easy as any of the eight would like as it becomes a proverbial planes, trains, and automobiles trek as they all get into one misadventure after another. In the process, they sometimes need to confide in others in order for assistance, thus spreading the money beyond more than just the eight of them. What they don't know is that the victim is Smiler Grogan, who stole the money 15 years ago. What they also don't know is that the Santa Rosita police, led by Captain Culpeper, had been following Grogan in order to discover where he hid the money. Culpeper, honest to a fault, knows that the eight were told where the money is, so all they need to do is clandestinely follow the eight to the money; discovering it would be the feather in his cap at the end of an illustrious career. But feeling unappreciated as viewed by the measly pension he will receive following retirement, Culpeper could have other thoughts about the best way to end his career.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0057193\/","Opening Date":"2\/17\/66","Closing Date":"3\/2\/66","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1966.0,"Title":"The Railroad Man","IMDb Title":"The Railroad Man","IMDb Year":"1956","Director":"Pietro Germi","Cast":"Pietro Germi, Luisa Della Noce, Sylva Koscina, Saro Urz\u201c","Country":"Italy","Certification":"Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Italy:T, Japan:G, Netherlands:14, Norway:16, Spain:13, Spain:7, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:A, United States:Not Rated","Genre":"Drama","Runtime":"115","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BYjJkNWQyODctOTgxZi00MzRmLWFkYTQtZGMzYWE1ZWEzNWI2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR1,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"The railroad engineer Andrea Marcocci has been working with his partner and friend Gigi Liverani for thirty years and feels happy and proud of his work, drinking wine after hours with his friends in a bar owned by the former railroad man Ugo.

Helen uses the word \"sensitive\" to describe Carol's overall demeanor, which is almost like she walks around in a daze, rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up, it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses, such as Helen's boyfriend Michael's invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work. There, she is almost hypnotized by her solitude, which leads to her mental state deteriorating as those obsessions come to the fore. She quickly descends into madness, which ultimately also affects those that are trying to get in touch with her.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0059646\/","Opening Date":"6\/2\/66","Closing Date":"6\/15\/66","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1966.0,"Title":"The Leather Boys","IMDb Title":"The Leather Boys","IMDb Year":"1964","Director":"Sidney J.

Amongst the volunteers, there is a young British soldier, Private Arthur James Hamp (Sir Tom Courtenay), who is the sole survivor of his original company. Hamp spent three years in the trenches, and this makes him a veteran. He has never been accused of cowardice, but one day, he simply decides to leave the war behind him and walk all the way home to Britain. In Calais, France, he is challenged by a Military Police patrol, who promptly arrests him for leaving without permission. Hamp's commanding officers decide to convene a court-martial and charge him with desertion. If found guilty, Hamp could be shot by a firing squad. Captain Hargreaves (Sir Dirk Bogarde) is assigned to be Hamp's defending attorney, but he seems skeptical about the deserter's chances of acquittal. During their first talk, Captain Hargreaves is impressed by his client's utter sincerity and naivete. He learns that his client volunteered on a dare by his friends back home, spent three years in the front-line trenches, remained sole survivor of his company, and that he decided to leave the war and return home. When Hargreaves asks Hamp why he decided to leave the war, Hamp simply says that he got tired of watching his comrades die, and that the noises of war made him sick. On top of that, Hamp argued he received news from home about his wife's unfaithfulness. All of these reasons made him want to leave the war behind and return home to England. Captain Hargreaves remains unsympathetic. The military doctor's report indicated that deserter Hamp does not suffer from shell-shock and Captain Hargreaves accepts that fact. However, suspecting that his client's case is a more complex and peculiar case, Captain Hargreaves believes that Hamp is not responsible for his actions. He prepares the best he can for the upcoming court-martial.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0058263\/","Opening Date":"7\/28\/66","Closing Date":"8\/3\/66","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1966.0,"Title":"A Married Woman","IMDb Title":"A Married Woman","IMDb Year":"1964","Director":"Jean-Luc Godard","Cast":"Bernard No\u2018l, Macha M\u040bril, Philippe Leroy, Christophe Bourseiller","Country":"France","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:SOA, Australia:M, Finland:K-16, France:16, Germany:12, Italy:VM18, Italy:T, Mexico:B15, Norway:16, Portugal:(Banned), Spain:18::(ICAA), Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:15::(video), United States:Not Rated, United States:TV-PG::(TV rating), West Germany:18::(nf)","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Runtime":"95","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjVkNWMyYTMtNzg2Ny00ZTU0LWFmNjktNGExYmI1MTgxODRhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR5,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Charlotte is young and modern, not a hair out of place, superficial, cool; she reads fashion magazines - does she have the perfect bust?

She is a waitress and has a young daughter. She tells John that her name is Anita. They have met many times, but their first personal meeting is when both are swimming in early morning. John is asked to have morning coffee with Anna's family. He invites her and her child to a trip to Zoo in Copenhagen. Both have genuine feelings for each other. There are lovely three-some scenes when John is proud of \"being\" a father, and beautiful love scenes. Christina Schollin's naked body is cute but never obtrusive. But at that time girls were depreciated if they \"gave in\" too soon. So these scenes repeatedly alternate with hot misunderstandings, well-known exactly when two people with genuine feelings fear misunderstandings and try to preclude them. In the last minutes of the movie, when each has left the \"harbour village\" on the next day, and John has learned the real name of \"Anita\" and calls her from the boat, both realise without saying anything about it, that this is the beginning of a long relationship based on mutual feelings.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0058281\/","Opening Date":"10\/20\/66","Closing Date":"11\/16\/66","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1966.0,"Title":"Stop the World - I Want to Get Off","IMDb Title":"Stop the World: I Want to Get Off","IMDb Year":"1966","Director":"Philip Saville","Cast":"Tony Tanner, Millicent Martin, Leila Croft, Valerie Croft","Country":"United Kingdom","Certification":"United Kingdom:A","Genre":"Musical","Runtime":"100","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTFhNDhlOTktZTliZS00YTZiLTk4NTgtNTliYmZlMjlkMDFhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"The lead in a British semi-improvisational musical theater troupe introduces the troupe's featured players - his wife, two adult daughters and adolescent son - as they rehearse for their next performance.

One of George's primary responsibilities is to deal with dangerous animals that may be chronically threatening to humans, livestock and\/or crops. It is in this vein that George and his staff end up killing a man eating lion and its lioness, resulting in their three young female cubs being orphaned. Although difficult to begin, George and Joy are able to wean and take care of the three cubs, who they adopt as pets. But soon, they know they have to provide a more suitable environment for the cubs, namely sending them to Rotterdam Zoo... that is except for the smallest, who they have named Elsa and to who Joy in particular has become attached as the emotional fighter among the three. As Elsa grows into lioness maturity, George and Joy provide her with greater freedom away from their property, which may get her into trouble as a largely tame animal. Ultimately, John Kendall, George's boss, directs them to send Elsa to a zoo like they did with her sisters, especially as with anyone in George's job he is soon being reassigned. Joy cannot bear the thought of Elsa being locked up for the rest of her life, believing that they can reintegrate her back into the wild instead, something that had never been done with a tame lion. John gives them three months to accomplish this task, which most specifically involves getting Elsa to be able to kill for food, other creatures which up to this point she has seen only as fellow playthings, and to be accepted by other lions, most specifically mate with and provide food for a male partner while standing up successfully to female competitors.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0060182\/","Opening Date":"11\/24\/66","Closing Date":"11\/30\/66","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1966.0,"Title":"Mademoiselle","IMDb Title":"Mademoiselle","IMDb Year":"1966","Director":"Tony Richardson","Cast":"Jeanne Moreau, Ettore Manni, Umberto Orsini, Keith Skinner","Country":"United Kingdom, France","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:M, Finland:K-16, France:18, Italy:VM18, New Zealand:R16, Norway:16, Portugal:(Banned), Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:15::(DVD rating), United States:Not Rated, West Germany:18::(f)","Genre":"Drama","Runtime":"105","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZmM3OWEyNWEtMTMyNi00ZTc2LWJlOTktZmQ1NDRkN2U3ZWI3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"In a French village, Manou is an Italian logger, virile, with a broad laugh.

It's the period when Dylan is shifting from acoustic to electric, a transition that not all fans, including Baez, applaud. From the opening sequence of Dylan holding up words to the soundtrack's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" Dylan is playful and enigmatic.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0061589\/","Opening Date":"1\/18\/68","Closing Date":"1\/24\/68","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1968.0,"Title":"The Tiger Makes Out","IMDb Title":"The Tiger Makes Out","IMDb Year":"1967","Director":"Arthur Hiller","Cast":"Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Bob Dishy, John Harkins","Country":"United States","Certification":"Brazil:12, Norway:16, United Kingdom:A, United States:Approved::(certificate no. 21536)","Genre":"Comedy","Runtime":"94","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOWRjNDk3NTUtNzFmOS00NTQ2LTk3MjAtZWU2ZDU0MDQ5YzM0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Ben Harris, an embittered, middle-aged New York City postal worker living in a Greenwich Village basement, becomes obsessed with the idea of kidnapping and enslaving the first beautiful young woman he can get his hands on.

The Emperor Franz-Joseph and his son, the Crown Prince, Archduke Rudolf, have never seen eye to eye. While the Emperor retains the traditions of the empire in the rapidly changing world keeping it a police state, Rudolf is liberal, wanting to see the people have a say in what happens in their lives. Rudolf even rejected the Emperor's choice of a Spanish wife for him, he instead choosing Belgian Stephanie as his wife, that marriage which he himself never saw and will never see as anything more than a political alliance, Stephanie who he considers a shrew. While Rudolf has almost an unhealthy infatuation with his mother, the Empress Elizabeth, she has largely been an absent figure from Vienna and thus his life. As Franz-Joseph has had his steady mistress in Elizabeth's frequent absences, he has allowed Rudolf to have the same in the form of actress Mitzi Kaspar as the Emperor knows she could never be more than a dalliance and as she retains a certain balance within the royal house. Things change when Rudolf meets twenty year old Baroness Maria Vetsera. Their attraction begins as a clandestine affair which then grows into love which Rudolf increasingly flaunts in public in wanting always to be with her. This does not sit well with Franz-Joseph, his secret police who do whatever they need to retain the Emperor's natural order. As such, Rudolf tries to find options to make Maria his wife, one, with the help of his good friend, Edward, the Prince of Wales, to live as commoners in England, or two, to support the imminent and secret uprising in Hungary, they who want Rudolf as their King, which in realistic terms means an act of treason on Rudolf's part against his father.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0064645\/","Opening Date":"12\/18\/69","Closing Date":"12\/24\/69","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1969.0,"Title":"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice","IMDb Title":"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice","IMDb Year":"1969","Director":"Paul Mazursky","Cast":"Natalie Wood, Robert Culp, Elliott Gould, Dyan Cannon","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:SOA, Australia:M, Canada:R, Finland:K-16, France:16, Germany:16, Iceland:12, Ireland:15::(DVD rating), Italy:VM18, Italy:T::(re-rated), Netherlands:18, New Zealand:R18, Norway:16, Portugal:M\/18, Spain:18, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:15::(DVD rating), United Kingdom:15::(video rating), United States:R, West Germany:18::(nf)","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Runtime":"105","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNDE3MDdmMTAtNWRhOC00NzI0LThhOTQtZjQxN2RjOTQ3ZjQ1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Documentary-filmmaker Bob Sanders and his wife Carol attend a group-therapy session that serves as the backdrop for the film's opening scenes.

The organization's charismatic leader - the deputy - is scheduled to arrive in the town from the capital the day of the rally. Beyond the problems arranging the rally due to the probable incitement of violence at such a rally, the organization learns of an unconfirmed report that there will be an attempt on the deputy's life. The rally does happen, after which a three-wheeled kamikaze runs over the deputy, who eventually passes away from his injuries. The official report is that the incident was a drunken accident. In reality, the deputy's death was murder orchestrated by the secret police, the general for who likens the pacifist organization to mildew killing off agricultural crops. A magistrate is assigned to the case. Although he does have political views, he is more interested in finding out the truth, and as such has to wade through the political rhetoric and politically motivated testimony he hears. Thrown into the mix is a photojournalist who too is looking for the truth, as it, he believes, will make a great front page story.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0065234\/","Opening Date":"6\/18\/70","Closing Date":"8\/5\/70","Days Played":49.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1970.0,"Title":"Hello, Dolly!","IMDb Title":"Hello, Dolly!","IMDb Year":"1969","Director":"Gene Kelly","Cast":"Barbra Streisand, Walter Matthau, Michael Crawford, Marianne McAndrew","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:G, Brazil:Livre, Canada:PG::(Ontario), Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Iceland:L, Italy:T, Japan:G, Netherlands:AL::(orginal rating), New Zealand:G, Norway:A::(streaming rating), Norway:7::(cinema rating), Peru:Apt, Russia:0+, Singapore:PG, Spain:A, Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:U, United Kingdom:U::(tv rating), United Kingdom:U::(video rating), United States:G","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Musical, Romance","Runtime":"146","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BODk3MmYzOWYtNmQzZC00NTQyLWJjM2EtMDEzZjc3NDYxYWI4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"A matchmaker named Dolly Levi takes a trip to Yonkers, New York to see the \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire,\" Horace Vandergelder.

Upon his release the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah with whom he begins a relationship. The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, whom he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a desire for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of neighboring Bacteria. Ultimately Schultz, who has turned traitor against Hynkel's regime, and the barber may be able to join forces to take control of the situation, using Schultz's inside knowledge of the regime's workings and the barber's uncanny resemblance to one of those in power.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0032553\/","Opening Date":"9\/15\/72","Closing Date":"9\/21\/72","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1972.0,"Title":"Butterflies are Free","IMDb Title":"Butterflies Are Free","IMDb Year":"1972","Director":"Milton Katselas","Cast":"Goldie Hawn, Edward Albert, Eileen Heckart, Paul Michael Glaser","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:PG, Australia:NRC, Canada:PG, Finland:K-12, Iceland:L, Italy:T, Japan:G, Netherlands:14, New Zealand:R16, Norway:12, Peru:14, Singapore:PG, Spain:18, Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:PG::(video), United States:PG, West Germany:12","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music, Romance","Runtime":"109","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BM2NkODY2ZjMtYmRmYS00ZTdhLTgxM2QtNGIyNTMyYmI1NTAzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"All Don Baker wants is a place of his own away from his over-protective mother.

Primarily, he is moving between three general time periods and locations. The first is his stint as a GI during WWII, when, as a pacifist, he was acting as a Chaplain's assistant for his unit. This time is largely as a POW, where he was in Dresden the day of the bombing, spending it with among others an older compassionate GI named Edgar Derby, and a brash loudmouth GI named Paul Lazzaro. The second is his life as an optometrist in Ilium in upstate New York, eventually married to the wealthy and overbearing Valencia Merble, and having two offspring, Robert, who would spend his teen-aged years as a semi-delinquent, and Barbara, who would end up much like her mother. And the third is as an abductee on the planet Tralfamadore, along with his devoted dog Spot, and Hollywood starlet Montana Wildhack - who was not averse to taking off her clothes to further her career - the Tralfamadorians who have put them on display. The more time he spends on Tralfamadore, the more he understands the meaning of what is happening to him.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0069280\/","Opening Date":"11\/10\/72","Closing Date":"12\/21\/72","Days Played":42.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1972.0,"Title":"MarJoe","IMDb Title":"Marjoe","IMDb Year":"1972","Director":"Sarah Kernochan, Howard Smith","Cast":"Agnes Benjamin, Marjoe Gortner, Vernon Gortner, Sarah Kernochan","Country":"United States","Certification":"Netherlands:12, Netherlands:14, Norway:16, United Kingdom:AA, United States:PG","Genre":"Documentary, Biography","Runtime":"88","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BYWFlNGNkYTAtNzFkNC00N2Q0LThlNzItMzQ4YjE1YTAwNGQ4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Part documentary, part expose, this film follows one-time child evangelist Marjoe Gortner on the \"church tent\" Revivalist circuit, commenting on the showmanship of Evangelism and \"the religion business\", prior to the start of \"televangelism\".","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0068924\/","Opening Date":"11\/24\/72","Closing Date":"12\/21\/72","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1972.0,"Title":"Young Winston","IMDb Title":"Young Winston","IMDb Year":"1972","Director":"Richard Attenborough","Cast":"Simon Ward, Peter Cellier, Ronald Hines, Dino Shafeek","Country":"United Kingdom","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:G, Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Iceland:12, Japan:G, Norway:12::(iTunes rating), Norway:16, Peru:Apt, Portugal:M\/12, Sweden:11, United Kingdom:PG::(TV rating), United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:PG::(video rating), United States:PG","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Runtime":"157","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOGY1YTk3NWMtMDY0MC00ZWJkLWEyOGUtYWY3MjgzZTFiNmViXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"This historical drama is an account of the early life of the future British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill (Simon Ward), including his childhood, his time as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Second Boer War, and culminating in his first election to Parliament.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0069528\/","Opening Date":"12\/22\/72","Closing Date":"2\/15\/73","Days Played":56.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1972.0,"Title":"Travels with My Aunt","IMDb Title":"Travels with My Aunt","IMDb Year":"1972","Director":"George Cukor","Cast":"Maggie Smith, Alec McCowen, Louis Gossett Jr., Robert Stephens","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:M, Australia:PG::(TV rating), Canada:PG, Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Greece:K-12, Netherlands:14, New Zealand:R16, Norway:7::(recommended rating), Norway:16::(cinema rating), Spain:13, Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:AA, United States:TV-PG, United States:TV-14::(Blu-ray\/DVD), United States:PG, West Germany:12","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Runtime":"108","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZGVkNDE3ZjgtNjBlNi00MjcxLWE1YWItN2I5MTBiODhhYmI2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"At his mother's funeral, stuffy bank clerk Henry Pulling meets his Aunt Augusta Bertram (Dame Maggie Smith), an elderly eccentric with more-than-shady dealings who pulls him along on a whirlwind adventure as she attempts to rescue an old lover.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0069404\/","Opening Date":"12\/22\/72","Closing Date":"1\/11\/73","Days Played":21.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1973.0,"Title":"Fat City","IMDb Title":"Fat City","IMDb Year":"1972","Director":"John Huston","Cast":"Stacy Keach, Jeff Bridges, Susan Tyrrell, Candy Clark","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:M, Canada:PG, Finland:K-16, Germany:12, Italy:T, Mexico:B, New Zealand:R16, Norway:12::(recommended rating), Norway:16::(cinema rating), Spain:18, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:AA, United Kingdom:12::(DVD), United Kingdom:15::(video rating), United States:PG","Genre":"Drama, Sport","Runtime":"96","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZDdkNzFlNzctNzA2Mi00OGI3LWE3ODAtZTYyOWM4MTBkYzMwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"The film tells the story of two boxers and their problems.

Without much money, he plans on making a living teaching English while living in an inexpensive rooming house, where he befriends another of the tenants, American Sally Bowles. She is outwardly a flamboyant, perpetually happy person who works as a singer at the decadent Kit Kat Klub, a cabaret styled venue. Sally's outward fa\u040cade is matched by that of the Klub, overseen by the omnipresent Master of Ceremonies. Sally draws Brian into her world, and initially wants him to be one of her many lovers, until she learns that he is a homosexual, albeit a celibate one. Among their other friends are his students, the poor Fritz Wendel, who wants to be a gigolo to live a comfortable life, and the straight-laced and beautiful Natalia Landauer, a Jewish heiress. Fritz initially sees Natalia as his money ticket, but eventually falls for her. However Natalia is suspect of his motives and cannot overcome their religious differences.

On the sly, Buddy, who is the head of the team, gets much of the information for the cases from Vito Lucia, a childhood friend who still lives and works in the old neighborhood where much of the crime is based. Vito knows that his life could be in danger if the mob finds out that he acts as a snitch for the police.

In March 1969, under the Beaufort School District, he starts a job teaching at a small poor school located on Daufuskie Island, an island in a South Carolina river delta that is accessible only by boat. The island is inhabited exclusively by Black people. Conroy quickly learns that his students, who have never left the island, lack not only a basic understanding of academic items such as the alphabet and simple arithmetic, but also of other basic necessities of life such as personal hygiene. They can't even pronounce his name; they call him Conrack. The teachers before him, including the school principal, Mrs. Scott, have always treated the students like they are just slow; indeed, like they are completely unteachable. Conrack, a free-thinking man, decides to expose his students not only to the academic subjects but also to the gamut of life skills from brushing one's teeth to human anatomy, and some of the fun things in life like classical music, art, baseball, movies, swimming (despite living on an island, the islanders fear of the river because they don't know how to swim), and Halloween. He does so with compassion and without being patronizing. His teaching methods come under question by both Mrs. Scott and the Beaufort School District administration led by its superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. These differences in viewpoint could place Conrack's tenure at the school in jeopardy.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0071358\/","Opening Date":"5\/3\/74","Closing Date":"5\/30\/74","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1974.0,"Title":"Zardoz","IMDb Title":"Zardoz","IMDb Year":"1974","Director":"John Boorman","Cast":"Sean Connery, Charlotte Rampling, Sara Kestelman, John Alderton","Country":"Ireland, United States","Certification":"Australia:M, Canada:18::(video rating), Finland:K-16, France:Tous publics, Iceland:16, Italy:VM14, Netherlands:18, Netherlands:12, New Zealand:M, New Zealand:R18, Norway:16, Singapore:M18, South Korea:15, Spain:18, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:15::(video), United States:R, West Germany:16","Genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","Runtime":"105","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNGRmYzRkMmQtZmFlMC00YmZjLWI5NDktNGM4ZmI4YzNkNTcwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR1,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"In 2293, Zardoz--an unseen \"God\" who speaks through an idol, a large stone statue of a head--leads a barbaric race called the Brutals, who live a harsh existence in the Outlands. Zardoz tells the Brutals that once they die, they will be transported to the Vortex, where they will live happily as Immortals. He has armed a small group, the Exterminators, with guns, as Zardoz's philosophy is that killing is good, and procreation is the root of all that is bad. In reality, Zardoz is Arthur Frayn, from a competing, more advanced race called \"the Eternals\", who live in paradise in the Vortex. The Eternals truly are immortal as they do not age and their bodies undergo reconstruction if they \"die\". They truly do not believe in procreation as their society has reached perfect equilibrium. Past human acts such as sex and sleep are obsolete in their advanced state. All major decisions are achieved through pure democracy. The Eternals, however, are not immune to non-life-threatening disease or sin; the latter is punishable by aging, only making their life less pleasant, but not ever killing them. Arthur's mission as Zardoz is to control, monitor, and study the Brutals for the Eternals. Being in the Outlands, Arthur is isolated without communication back to the Vortex and the Eternals. In his work as an Exterminator, Zed is accidentally able to find his way to the Vortex as a still-alive being. The Eternals vote to keep Zed alive temporarily so that they can study him before they kill him. Among the Eternals who have direct interactions with Zed are: May, the lead scientist, who believes Zed is a blessing in that they have not had access to a Brutal in some time; Friend, a hedonist who wants to use Zed as the animal he considers him to be; and Consuela, the hard-lined one who believes in vigilante justice. In the Eternals' access to Zed, they might learn whether his making it to the Vortex was indeed an accident--and their so-called Utopian society might be exposed for what it truly is.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0070948\/","Opening Date":"5\/17\/74","Closing Date":"6\/6\/74","Days Played":21.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1974.0,"Title":"Fred H.

He is renowned within the profession as being the best, one who designs and constructs his own surveillance equipment. He is an intensely private and solitary man in both his personal and professional life, which especially irks Stan, his business associate who often feels shut out of what is happening with their work.

Edward's will states that Patrick is to be raised Protestant in a \"traditional\" manner and that the trustee, Mr. Babcock of the Knickerbocker Bank, will pay Mame for expenses incurred in raising Patrick, but he has the right to refuse to pay if he deems that she's not honoring the spirit of Edward's will. Mr. Babcock and Patrick's longtime nanny, the timid Agnes Gooch, are to ensure that Patrick is raised correctly. Edward included these stipulations in his will knowing that his sister is a flamboyant, freewheeling, eccentric woman who can be considered anything but traditional or conventional. Despite the disruption each provides in the other's life, Mame and Patrick form a loving, supportive relationship. Mame wants to provide her sense of guidance to Patrick, which means exposing him to a broad spectrum of all that life has to offer. That changes when Mr. Babcock learns what is going on, and the stock market crashes resulting in Mame losing all her money, the events in combination leading to Mr. Babcock enrolling Patrick in boarding school to remove him from Mame's daily influence.

Annie Miller, more regularly referred to as Daisy, of Schenectady, New York, is on a grand tour of Europe with her mother, Mrs. Ezra Miller, her precocious adolescent brother, Randolph Miller, and their manservant, Eugenio. It is at their stop in Vevey, Switzerland that Daisy meets Frederick Winterbourne, an American expat studying in Geneva. Frederick has mixed emotions about Daisy. On the one hand, he is captivated by her beauty. On the other, he believes her to be uneducated and improper in her modern American attitude and behavior, she basically doing whatever she wants regardless of the possible perception of impropriety by those in Frederick's social circle. That latter view is shared by Frederick's aunt, Mrs. Costello, with who he is traveling. Conversely, Daisy finds Frederick to be stiff. Regardless, Daisy does allow Frederick to spend time with her as they move from Vevey to Rome, Italy in their individual parallel travels. Through this time, Frederick becomes more torn about Daisy, especially as she is not averse to flirting with Mr. Giovanelli, who she meets in Rome, she preferring to walk on the arms of both Giovanelli and Frederick at the same time in public. That torn feeling is exacerbated by the talk of others, especially judgmental Mrs. Walker who is not averse to using her social standing to exert her will on others. That mixed feeling is also in that Frederick is unaware if Daisy's behavior is truly and knowingly improper and hurtful to those around her, or if she is only an innocent in her joie de vivre. He may ultimately get his answer, but by that time it may be too late for him to express his true feelings for her in return.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0071385\/","Opening Date":"7\/19\/74","Closing Date":"8\/15\/74","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1974.0,"Title":"Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry","IMDb Title":"Dirty Mary Crazy Larry","IMDb Year":"1974","Director":"John Hough","Cast":"Peter Fonda, Susan George, Adam Roarke, Kenneth Tobey","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:M, Finland:K-16, Iceland:12, India:A, Italy:VM14, Norway:16, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:15::(tv rating), United Kingdom:15::(video rating), United States:PG, West Germany:16","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Runtime":"93","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNmY1ZWZlMTgtYWViNS00YmI5LTk2NWQtYzdjMDc0ZGQwYWJmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Larry Rayder is an aspiring NASCAR driver; Deke Sommers is a mechanic.

At every literal and figurative turn, Larry needs to show his superiority as a driver, while trying to ditch Mary, who is a little more resourceful in staying with them than he anticipates.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0071424\/","Opening Date":"8\/16\/74","Closing Date":"9\/19\/74","Days Played":35.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1974.0,"Title":"That's Entertainment","IMDb Title":"That's Entertainment!","IMDb Year":"1974","Director":"Jack Haley Jr.","Cast":"Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly, Peter Lawford","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:G, Brazil:Livre, Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Iceland:L, Ireland:G::(DVD rating), Japan:G, Netherlands:AL, New Zealand:G, Norway:A::(recommended rating), Norway:7::(cinema rating), Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:U, United States:G::(Approved No. 23840), West Germany:6::(f)","Genre":"Documentary, Family, Musical","Runtime":"135","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZmU4YzBhODMtMGYyMi00ZTkxLTk0MDItOWY3YzZhM2E3ODU4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"MGM musical numbers from the introduction of sound in the late '20s through to the 1950s, possibly with Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, and Judy Garland getting the most coverage.

The slightly off-kilter cast of characters are affected by time and location, the social mores dictated largely by Catholicism, and the national fervor surrounding Il Duce aka Benito Mussolini and Fascism. The stories loosely center on mid-teen Titta and his household, including his adolescent brother, his ever-supportive mother who is always defending him against his father, his freeloading maternal Uncle Lallo, and his paternal grandfather who slyly has eyes and hands for the household maid. Other townsfolk include: town beauty Gradisca, who can probably have any man she wants but generally has none as most think she out of their league; Volpina, the prostitute; Giudizio, the historian; a blind accordionist; and an extremely buxom tobacconist. The several vignettes presented include: the town bonfire in celebration of spring; life at Titta's school with his classmates and teachers; Titta's father Aurelio at his beachfront construction worksite and his and his workmates' encounter with Volpina; Titta's confessions to the priest about his burgeoning sexuality; Aurelio being questioned by authorities about his anti-Fascist leanings; a fantasy sequence at the luxurious Grand Hotel; a family outing with Aurelio's institutionalized brother Teo; many townsfolk embarking on a sail to witness a marine event passing by their town; an annual car race; Titta's fantasy encounter with the tobacconist after closing hours coming true; events surrounding the big snowfall that year, including a family tragedy; and an event centering on Gradisca and her future.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0071129\/","Opening Date":"2\/28\/75","Closing Date":"3\/20\/75","Days Played":21.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1975.0,"Title":"Memory of Us","IMDb Title":"The Memory of Us","IMDb Year":"1974","Director":"H.

Regardless, famed and fastidious Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who needs to get back to London immediately, is able to secure last minute passage in the compartment with the assistance of his friend, Signor Bianchi, one of the directors of the train line who is also making the trip. Some of the first class passengers seem concerned about Poirot's presence on the train. At least one of them has reason to be concerned, as later, another first class passenger, who earlier in the trip asked Poirot to provide protection for him due to several death threats, is found murdered in his stateroom by multiple stabbings. At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to Bianchi as not to get the Yugoslav police involved. Poirot quickly learns that the victim was not who he presented himself to be and has a connection to a five-year-old American kidnapping and murder case of infant Daisy Armstrong, murdered in spite of the fact that her parents had paid the requested ransom. The murderer in that case has long been convicted and executed but the ransom moneys were never recovered, a known accomplice never captured, and both the Armstrong parents have since tragically died. As Poirot questions the train's valet, the victim's accompanying staff, and the other primarily well off first class passengers and their accompanying servants, who are all on the surface more than cooperative, he finds that many had opportunity and motive, the latter which may not be obvious. There is also a great deal of evidence discovered on the train, which pulls his thoughts in many directions. These pieces of information may complicate the deduction of who is the murderer.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0071877\/","Opening Date":"3\/14\/75","Closing Date":"4\/17\/75","Days Played":35.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1975.0,"Title":"Jeremiah Johnson","IMDb Title":"Jeremiah Johnson","IMDb Year":"1972","Director":"Sydney Pollack","Cast":"Robert Redford, Will Geer, Delle Bolton, Josh Albee","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:PG, Australia:NRC, Belgium:AL\/Tous, Canada:PG, Finland:K-16, France:Tous publics, India:UA, Ireland:12, Italy:T, Japan:G, Netherlands:12, Netherlands:14, Netherlands:14, Norway:16, Philippines:PG-13::(MTRCB), Poland:12::(TV rating), Russia:12+, Singapore:PG, Spain:A::(ICAA), Sweden:15, United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:PG::(video), United States:GP, West Germany:12::(f)","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Runtime":"108","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNWU5NzJhNWQtOWYxZS00YzI3LTg1YjAtZWMyNWEwZmUzODU2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"During the mid-nineteenth century, Jeremiah Johnson, after a stint in the US Army, decides that he would prefer a life of solitude and more importantly peace by living with nature in the mountains of the frontier of the American west.

Whether they want to admit it, all the women in his life are for the most part aware that they are are not the only one with whom he is sleeping. And some, such as the wealthy and married Felicia Karpf, have a stronger emotional dependence on George than they would like to admit. George's current girlfriend is Jill, an up and coming actress. Jill's best friend is Jackie Shawn, one of George's old girlfriends who left him because he couldn't make a true commitment to her. In turn, Jackie is currently having an affair with Lester Karpf, Felicia's wealthy businessman husband. George is unhappy working at a salon owned by Norman, with whom he is constantly butting heads. In his first act of wanting finally to be a grown up, George wants to open his own salon, but doesn't have the financial resources to do it, and no bank will lend him money for the venture. Felicia at least convinces Lester to consider investing in George. On Monday, November 4, 1968, the eve of the presidential election, this group spends the evening together, first at a dinner party hosted by Lester, and then another private party.

Both Anne and Jonathan still miss David even after all these years. Going through puberty, Jonathan uses something he finds in his bedroom to explore the emerging thoughts of sexuality going through his mind. Although Anne knows Jonathan sneaks out of the house early in the morning against her orders, she is unaware that he is attending meetings of a secret society of five boys, who refer to each other only by a cardinal number, their rank within the group as assigned by \"The Chief\", number one. The Chief is an arrogant, sadistic pseudo-intellectual who needs to show his power and dominance over the other four in whatever means possible. He largely considers them immature as he spouts off his Nietzschean philosophies, centering on that adults create rules that ultimately disrupt the natural order of life. When the US based merchant ship the Belle docks in port, Anne and Jonathan meet Second Officer Jim Cameron. Jonathan, who is fascinated by the sea, becomes enamored with what Jim represents to him, the natural order the Chief speaks of, specifically of the sea. Anne becomes romantically involved with Jim while he is in town. Their encounters lead to Jim critically evaluating his life and future. As Jonathan believes Jim may be attempting to disrupt that natural order he so admires, Jonathan believes it is his duty to change Jim back to restore that natural order, and if that is not possible, to correct the impending disorder by whatever means necessary.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0075161\/","Opening Date":"7\/2\/76","Closing Date":"8\/19\/76","Days Played":49.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1976.0,"Title":"Grizzly","IMDb Title":"Grizzly","IMDb Year":"1976","Director":"William Girdler","Cast":"Christopher George, Andrew Prine, Richard Jaeckel, Joan McCall","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:14, Australia:M, Canada:14, Canada:18A, Finland:K-16, France:12, Iceland:16, Italy:VM14, Netherlands:16, Norway:15::(VOD), Norway:18::(video premiere), Sweden:15, United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:15::(video), United States:PG, United States:Not Rated, West Germany:16","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Thriller","Runtime":"91","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BODI2YzQ1N2EtNDg1Zi00OWM0LTlmNGMtM2ExYzE1MmRlZjczXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"A park ranger along with a military veteran helicopter pilot and a naturalist tries to halt the wild rampage of a prehistoric grizzly bear of 15 ft height and weighing 3,000 lb who's gone rogue n has developed a taste for human blood n flesh.

Each has no idea until their arrival at Two Two Twain who else will be in attendance. Those detectives are: amateur sleuths and New York City socialites Dick (David Niven) and Dora Charleston (Dame Maggie Smith), accompanied by their pet terrier, Myron; Belgian detective Monsieur Milo Perrier (James Coco), accompanied by his chauffeur, Marcel (James Cromwell); Shanghainese Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), accompanied by his Japanese adopted son, Willie Wang (Richard Narita); frumpish Brit Miss Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), accompanied by her invalid nurse, Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood); and San Francisco gumshoe Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), accompanied by his femme fatale sidekick, Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan). The dinner part of the invitation runs into problems due to the non-communication between Twain's blind butler, Jamesir Bensonmum (Sir Alec Guinness), and Twain's new deaf-mute and non-Anglophone cook, Yetta (Nancy Walker). On the murder side, the guests initially believe Twain will try to kill each of them. However, Twain eventually announces his rationale for the gathering: that one of the people at the dinner table will be murdered before midnight, and that Twain will consider himself the greatest detective if his guests, who are now trapped in the house until dawn, cannot figure out who committed the murder, that person also at the dinner table. If one does figure out who committed the crime, he or she will be the recipient of one million dollars and the exclusive rights to the story. So the guests anxiously await the stroke of midnight, with those still alive after that time trying to figure out motive and the opportunity to murder before the rise of dawn, and before the murderer has the opportunity to strike again on one or all of them.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0074937\/","Opening Date":"11\/26\/76","Closing Date":"12\/9\/76","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Cinema","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1976.0,"Title":"Across the Great DIvide","IMDb Title":"Across the Great Divide","IMDb Year":"1976","Director":"Stewart Raffill","Cast":"Robert Logan, Heather Rattray, Mark Edward Hall, George 'Buck' Flower","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:G, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Iceland:L, Italy:T, Japan:G, Norway:A::(recommended rating), Norway:7::(cinema rating), Portugal:M\/6, United Kingdom:U, United States:G","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family, Western","Runtime":"100","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNzk5Y2JmYjctM2FiZi00YmYxLWEyOTktNzJmMWU3YWQ2MzZlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"In this family classic, two orphans cross the Rocky Mountains on a quest to claim their inheritance, a 400-acre Oregon ranch.

Italian national Neapolitan Pasqualino Frafuso is a big-talking layabout who has grand ideas of his importance, especially in upholding the honor of his family, consisting of his mother and his seven less-than-attractive sisters. He admits to himself that he too is less than handsome, but believes he nonetheless attracts the romantic interest of most women. In upholding his sisters' honor he often calls himself Pasqualino Settebellezze, translated Pasqualino \"Seven Beauties\". Having gone AWOL from military service, he has just gotten off a train as a stowaway in an unknown locale when he meets another AWOL soldier, Francesco. They correctly assume that they're somewhere in Germany. Relaying his less-than-direct \"point A to point B\" story of how he arrived at this point, Pasqualino tells one in which every conscious decision was what he thought would be the path of greatest ease for himself in less-than-ideal circumstances, beginning with accidentally killing his sister Concettina's pimp (and, according to her, her lover and fianc\u040b), declaring insanity in the ensuing legal battles rather than going to prison, and choosing military service rather than continue to endure medical intervention, such as shock treatment, at the psychiatric hospital. Pasqualino and Francesco are quickly captured by the Germans and sent to a POW camp. Having already witnessed mass murders by the Germans both inside and outside the camp, Pasqualino makes another \"easier path\" decision in what ends up being a dangerous campaign of seducing the obese, sadistic female camp commandant.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0075040\/","Opening Date":"2\/25\/77","Closing Date":"3\/10\/77","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1977.0,"Title":"Wizards","IMDb Title":"Wizards","IMDb Year":"1977","Director":"Ralph Bakshi","Cast":"Bob Holt, Jesse Welles, Richard Romanus, David Proval","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:PG, Australia:NRC, Canada:PG::(Manitoba\/Ontario), Canada:A::(Nova Scotia), Canada:G::(Quebec), Finland:K-16, France:Tous publics, Iceland:12, Ireland:PG, Japan:G, Mexico:S\/C, Netherlands:16, New Zealand:PG::(DVD), New Zealand:M, Peru:14, Russia:12+::(TV rating), Singapore:NC-16::(DVD rating), Sweden:15, United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:PG::(video rating), United States:PG::(Approved No. 24849), United States:TV-14::(DLSV), West Germany:16::(nf)","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","Runtime":"82","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZjhjOTIwNDItOGUwNC00YjMxLTkxM2QtMzAzYzg0ZDQyN2U4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"In a post apocalyptic future that appears as a blend of World War II Europe and J.R.R.

To make money, the team's unknown owner makes its manager, Joe McGrath, do cheesy publicity much to the players' chagrin. Rumors abound among the players that if the local mill closes, the team will fold. Just before the official announcement is made, the team's aging player\/coach, Reggie Dunlop, does get wind that the mill is indeed closing and that this season will be the team's last. Beyond efforts to reconcile with his wife Francine, who loves Reggie but doesn't love his career, Reggie begins to focus on how to renew interest in the team for a possible sale as he knows if the team folds, his hockey career is over. Without telling anyone of his plan, he begins a rumor that the owner is negotiating a sale with a city in Florida. He also decides that \"goon\" hockey - most especially using the untapped talents of the recently acquired childlike but quietly menacing Hanson brothers - is the way to renew local interest. It works as the team begins to attract new fans, sell out games, sell out away games attended largely by their groupies, and win, which does fuel the rumor of a sale. The one team member who doesn't like this new style is Ned Braden, a college graduate who plays the game solely because he loves it. His hockey career is against the wishes of his tomboyish wife, Lily, who hates everything about Charlestown and being a hockey wife. Reggie's goal of winning the league championship and having the team sold takes a turn when he finally meets the team's owner and discovers the owner's motivations. Ned, with his own views of what is right and wrong in hockey, may come up with an unexpected way to achieve all their goals.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0076723\/","Opening Date":"4\/22\/77","Closing Date":"5\/19\/77","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1977.0,"Title":"Moonshine County Express","IMDb Title":"Moonshine County Express","IMDb Year":"1977","Director":"Gus Trikonis","Cast":"John Saxon, Susan Howard, William Conrad, Morgan Woodward","Country":"United States","Certification":"France:Tous publics, Iceland:16, Norway:16, Sweden:15, United States:PG, West Germany:Not Rated","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime, Drama","Runtime":"95","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNWY3ZDNmMDItMGNjYy00ZmNmLThlNTUtOWI0ZjFmODNjZTc0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":null,"IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0076409\/","Opening Date":"5\/6\/77","Closing Date":"5\/12\/77","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1977.0,"Title":"The Car","IMDb Title":"The Car","IMDb Year":"1977","Director":"Elliot Silverstein","Cast":"James Brolin, Kathleen Lloyd, John Marley, R.G.

Wade ends up leading the investigation and as more and more deaths occur, more evidence is collected *except* who the driver is. That increasing evidence includes the viciousness of the incidents and the seemingly nondestructive nature of the car. But what is happening may not be as simple as it appears on the surface, Wade and the others who will have to figure out the underlying issue to be able to neutralize the \"car\" hopefully forever.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0075809\/","Opening Date":"5\/13\/77","Closing Date":"5\/26\/77","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1977.0,"Title":"Citizens Band","IMDb Title":"Citizens Band","IMDb Year":"1977","Director":"Jonathan Demme","Cast":"Paul Le Mat, Candy Clark, Bruce McGill, Roberts Blossom","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:M, Canada:14A::(Ontario), Norway:16, United Kingdom:AA, United States:PG","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Runtime":"98","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMDQyMGU4NDItMGUyNy00MWY0LWJmZmQtODMzMWUyYmQ0ZDVlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"This movie interlaces the stories of several characters in a small town united by their use of CB (citizen's band) radio.

Those detectives are: amateur sleuths and New York City socialites Dick (David Niven) and Dora Charleston (Dame Maggie Smith), accompanied by their pet terrier, Myron; Belgian detective Monsieur Milo Perrier (James Coco), accompanied by his chauffeur, Marcel (James Cromwell); Shanghainese Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), accompanied by his Japanese adopted son, Willie Wang (Richard Narita); frumpish Brit Miss Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), accompanied by her invalid nurse, Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood); and San Francisco gumshoe Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), accompanied by his femme fatale sidekick, Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan). The dinner part of the invitation runs into problems due to the non-communication between Twain's blind butler, Jamesir Bensonmum (Sir Alec Guinness), and Twain's new deaf-mute and non-Anglophone cook, Yetta (Nancy Walker). On the murder side, the guests initially believe Twain will try to kill each of them. However, Twain eventually announces his rationale for the gathering: that one of the people at the dinner table will be murdered before midnight, and that Twain will consider himself the greatest detective if his guests, who are now trapped in the house until dawn, cannot figure out who committed the murder, that person also at the dinner table. If one does figure out who committed the crime, he or she will be the recipient of one million dollars and the exclusive rights to the story. So the guests anxiously await the stroke of midnight, with those still alive after that time trying to figure out motive and the opportunity to murder before the rise of dawn, and before the murderer has the opportunity to strike again on one or all of them.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0074937\/","Opening Date":"9\/2\/77","Closing Date":"9\/15\/77","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1977.0,"Title":"I Never Promised You A Rose Garden","IMDb Title":"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden","IMDb Year":"1977","Director":"Anthony Page","Cast":"Kathleen Quinlan, Bibi Andersson, Ben Piazza, Lorraine Gary","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:M, Finland:K-16, France:12, Iceland:16, Netherlands:16::(orginal rating), New Zealand:R16, Norway:18, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:18::(video rating), United States:R, West Germany:16","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy","Runtime":"96","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZjAzMTYyMDUtZGNkYS00YzRiLWFjYzYtODk0YWE2NWRiMjY4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Based very loosely on the intricate novel by Joanne Greenberg.

With Danny's help, Lionel is able to lose his virginity, although it isn't a totally satisfying experience.

The \"who\"s include a bevy of bed partners who don't generally include his wife, Simi Tomasis. He dotes on his son, Nico Tomasis, who he wants to follow in his footsteps in all aspects, Nico, a daredevil, especially in the air, also enjoying the high life in the process. Theo ends up divorcing Simi in order to marry Liz Cassidy, the grieving widow of US President James Cassidy, who was assassinated while he and Liz were walking on a beach. Liz's marriage to Theo is in part to escape the spotlight not only of being the widow of a President, but part of a high profile and powerful American political family, James' brother, John Cassidy, who was the Attorney General in James' administration. Theo had been attracted to Liz on first sight, meeting her and James when James was still a senator. Theo and Liz's marriage ends up being a passionate one in a turbulent way, that turbulence a result of the fundamental differences in their beings and the way they deal with people, and not just the other.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0077636\/","Opening Date":"5\/12\/78","Closing Date":"6\/15\/78","Days Played":35.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1978.0,"Title":"Deathsport","IMDb Title":"Deathsport","IMDb Year":"1978","Director":"Allan Arkush, Nicholas Niciphor, Roger Corman","Cast":"David Carradine, Claudia Jennings, Richard Lynch, William Smithers","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:M, France:Tous publics, New Zealand:R13, Spain:18, Sweden:(Banned), United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:18::(video rating), United States:R, West Germany:12::(nf)","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi, Sport, Thriller","Runtime":"82","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMzg3YmQ5MzMtMTVhNS00MDJkLTk5YjAtNDc1OWI4ODc5M2YwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"One thousand years into the future, after the Great Neutron Wars, the world is divided into desert wastes and isolated city-states.

On a cold winter day, her damaged car with her expensive fur coat is found abandoned at the side of a country road. While the authorities initially suspect that she could have committed suicide, her pompous husband, Col. Archibald Christie, who is less than cooperative with the authorities, is adamant that she is still alive. What he doesn't tell them is that he recently asked her for a divorce so that he could marry his secretary, Miss Nancy Neele. Although the divorce request was not a total surprise since she knew of the extramarital affair, Mrs. Christie still did not want to grant him the request since she still loves him. Concurrently, American newspaper columnist Wally Stanton was scheduled to conduct an interview with Mrs. Christie. Since he can no longer do so with her disappearance, Stanton instead tries to find out himself what happened to her.

He is seriously dating thirty-eight year old actress and singer Samantha Taylor (Dame Julie Andrews), who he loves, although he admits their connection is more intellectual than it is emotional. She, in turn, loves him, despite barely tolerating his often infantile behavior. This behavior includes spying on a neighbor's sexual encounters with a wide array of women, this spying about which the neighbor knows, as he does it himself. Driving one day, George spots a young woman who he believes is the most beautiful creature he's ever seen - an \"eleven\" on a scale of ten, tens which he didn't believe existed before her. Beyond the fact that she is probably half his age, a problem with George's infatuation is that she is just off to her own wedding. George and Sam's relationship takes a hit with an argument which is further exacerbated by a series of misunderstandings. As such, George decides to pursue the woman of his dreams with all of his energy. He learns her name is Jenny Miles, now married Jenny Hanley (Bo Derek), and he is able to follow her to a Mexican resort where she and her husband David Hanley (Sam J. Jones) are honeymooning. In his pursuit of Jenny, his encounter with a lonely woman named Mary Lewis (Dee Wallace), who is vacationing at the resort, and his discussions with his gay lyricist Hugh (Robert Webber) concerning his relationship with his much younger trophy husband Larry (Walter George Alton), George may come to a clearer picture of what he is doing in Mexico, and how he truly feels about Sam.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0078721\/","Opening Date":"10\/5\/79","Closing Date":"11\/15\/79","Days Played":42.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1979.0,"Title":"A Touch of Class","IMDb Title":"A Touch of Class","IMDb Year":"1973","Director":"Melvin Frank","Cast":"George Segal, Glenda Jackson, Paul Sorvino, K Callan","Country":"United Kingdom","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:M, Brazil:18, Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Italy:T, Netherlands:14, New Zealand:R16, Norway:16, Portugal:M\/12, Singapore:PG, Spain:18, Spain:13, Spain:18, Spain:16, Sweden:11, United Kingdom:AA, United Kingdom:12, United States:PG, West Germany:16::(f)","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Runtime":"106","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZmE5NWZlNzAtZTBjNy00MmM1LWIzOTYtYmEyMjVhNDQzMDk3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"American Steve Blackburn, in the insurance business, is married with two kids.

He is seriously dating thirty-eight year old actress and singer Samantha Taylor (Dame Julie Andrews), who he loves, although he admits their connection is more intellectual than it is emotional. She, in turn, loves him, despite barely tolerating his often infantile behavior. This behavior includes spying on a neighbor's sexual encounters with a wide array of women, this spying about which the neighbor knows, as he does it himself. Driving one day, George spots a young woman who he believes is the most beautiful creature he's ever seen - an \"eleven\" on a scale of ten, tens which he didn't believe existed before her. Beyond the fact that she is probably half his age, a problem with George's infatuation is that she is just off to her own wedding. George and Sam's relationship takes a hit with an argument which is further exacerbated by a series of misunderstandings. As such, George decides to pursue the woman of his dreams with all of his energy. He learns her name is Jenny Miles, now married Jenny Hanley (Bo Derek), and he is able to follow her to a Mexican resort where she and her husband David Hanley (Sam J. Jones) are honeymooning. In his pursuit of Jenny, his encounter with a lonely woman named Mary Lewis (Dee Wallace), who is vacationing at the resort, and his discussions with his gay lyricist Hugh (Robert Webber) concerning his relationship with his much younger trophy husband Larry (Walter George Alton), George may come to a clearer picture of what he is doing in Mexico, and how he truly feels about Sam.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0078721\/","Opening Date":"2\/8\/80","Closing Date":"2\/21\/80","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1980.0,"Title":"Jaws 2","IMDb Title":"Jaws 2","IMDb Year":"1978","Director":"Jeannot Szwarc","Cast":"Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, Joseph Mascolo","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:14, Australia:M, Brazil:14, Canada:14A, Canada:PG::(Manitoba), Canada:A::(Nova Scotia), Canada:AA::(Ontario), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Canada:14::(Nova Scotia), Finland:K-16, France:Tous publics, Greece:K-8, Hong Kong:II, Hungary:16, Iceland:16, India:A, Ireland:PG, Israel:12::(self-applied), Italy:T, Japan:PG-12, Malaysia:U, Mexico:B, Netherlands:12, New Zealand:PG, Norway:15::(DVD), Norway:16, Peru:14, Philippines:PG-13, Poland:16::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/12, Russia:16+, Singapore:PG, South Africa:10, South Korea:15::(DVD rating), Spain:14, Spain:13, Sweden:15, Turkey:13+::(self-applied), United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:PG, United States:TV-14::(DLSV), United States:PG, United States:TV-PG::(LV), United Arab Emirates:Not Rated, West Germany:16","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Thriller","Runtime":"116","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMzAxN2Q5Y2UtMDBkZS00MGQwLWIyZDEtYTgyNGRlZmZiNjI2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Four years after the traumatic episodes at Amity Island that was terrorized by a 25-foot-long great white shark devouring beachgoers until it was destroyed, Amity Island is at peace and opened a hotel at the Holiday Inn.

In the first, a group of research scientists from a variety of backgrounds are investigating the strange appearance of items in remote locations, primarily desert regions. In continuing their investigation, one of the lead scientists, a Frenchman named Claude Lacombe, incorporates the Kod\u2021ly method of music education as a means of communication in their work. The response, in turn, at first baffles the researchers, until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second, electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie, Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky, which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw, unlike some others, especially in some form of authority, who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy. That obsession both for Roy and Jillian is ratcheted up a notch when they begin to have a vision of a mound with vertical striations on its side as a key to what is going on. While the obsession negatively affects Roy's life as he knows it in its entirety, Jillian knows she has to find the answer as to its meaning, especially as it relates to her only child, three year old Barry Guiler, who may be more attuned to what is happening than the adult figures around him. These two stories have the potential to intersect if Roy and Jillian can discover where they've seen that mound before, and if they can overcome what they believe to be the lies perpetrated by those in authority in covering up what is going on.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0075860\/","Opening Date":"8\/8\/80","Closing Date":"8\/21\/80","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1980.0,"Title":"Used Cars","IMDb Title":"Used Cars","IMDb Year":"1980","Director":"Robert Zemeckis","Cast":"Kurt Russell, Jack Warden, Gerrit Graham, Frank McRae","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:M, Brazil:14, Canada:14A::(Ontario), Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Iceland:L, India:U::(TV rating), India:A, Netherlands:12, Norway:15, Spain:16, Spain:13, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:AA, United Kingdom:15, United States:TV-14::(DLSV), United States:R, West Germany:12","Genre":"Comedy","Runtime":"113","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNTY3Zjg2ODQtNjdhNS00OWY1LThkODEtYWYyNDliNzI3ZTlhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Used car salesman Rudy Russo (Kurt Russell) needs money to run for State Senate, so he approaches his boss Luke (Jack Warden).

He, his Puerto Rican wife Jeri, his teen-aged daughter Joan and his mother-in-law, all who were planning on going on the run, are murdered by the mob because Jack was going to inform on them to the FBI. Before they're killed, Jack and Jeri are able to send their six-year old son Phil to Jeri's friend and their neighbor, Gloria Swenson, for safe keeping. Also with Phil is the book which contains all the information Jack was going to turn over. Gloria and Phil have an antagonistic relationship, not so much for who they are but what they are, Phil a kid, and Gloria a strange white woman who hates kids. As an ex-mistress of a mobster, Gloria learns that the people that killed the Dawns are old friends of hers. As Gloria and Phil go on the run both from the mob and from the authorities (who believe she kidnapped Phil) throughout New York City, Gloria has to come up with a plan on how best to save themselves, which is not easy because of their love\/hate relationship and the fact that precocious Phil has a mind of his own. That plan includes what to do with the book, but more importantly how to save Phil as the mob would still be after him regardless of the book just in case he knows something about his father's dealings. All through their ordeal, Gloria is not averse to shooting to kill, especially if those who she is trying to kill are trying to kill her and Phil first.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0080798\/","Opening Date":"11\/21\/80","Closing Date":"12\/18\/80","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1980.0,"Title":"Popeye","IMDb Title":"Popeye","IMDb Year":"1980","Director":"Robert Altman","Cast":"Robin Williams, Shelley Duvall, Ray Walston, Paul Dooley","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:G, Brazil:Livre, Canada:G::(Canadian Home Video rating), Finland:K-8, France:Tous publics, Germany:6, Iceland:L, India:U, Ireland:G, Japan:G, Netherlands:6, New Zealand:G, Norway:12, Portugal:M\/6, Singapore:PG, South Korea:All, Spain:A::(ICAA), Sweden:7, United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:U, United States:PG::(Approved No. 26147), United States:TV-PG::(V, TV Rating.), West Germany:6::(f)","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy, Musical, Romance","Runtime":"114","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOWVlMWUxMmEtOGFlZS00MDJmLWE1NWQtZWI5MGMxZmU2NDIxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Popeye, a squinty-eyed, corncob-pipe-smoking, spinach-hating, mumbling sailor man with overly muscular forearms partly the result of genetics, has just arrived in the port town of Sweethaven. He has been sailing the seven seas in search of his father who abandoned him when he was two. He is viewed suspiciously by many in town, with an exception of Wimpy, who will become friends with anyone who will buy him a hamburger. One who does view him suspiciously is Olive Oyl, the lanky, workboots-wearing daughter of his rooming-house landlords. Popeye and Olive gradually fall in love while they discover and decide to raise an abandoned infant boy whom Popeye names Swee'pea in honor of the town. Olive had been engaged to town bully Bluto, who rules Sweethaven on behalf of the mysterious Commodore, and Bluto does not take this sudden competition lying down: he uses Swee'pea to get Olive back. What happens in this situation in Popeye fighting for both Olive and Swee'pea is partly affected by discovering what happened to his father.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0081353\/","Opening Date":"12\/12\/80","Closing Date":"1\/22\/81","Days Played":42.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1980.0,"Title":"A Change of Seasons","IMDb Title":"A Change of Seasons","IMDb Year":"1980","Director":"Richard Lang, Noel Black","Cast":"Shirley MacLaine, Anthony Hopkins, Bo Derek, Michael Brandon","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:M, Finland:K-16, France:Tous publics, Iceland:L, Italy:T, Netherlands:16::(original theatrical rating), Netherlands:6::(DVD rating), New Zealand:R18, Norway:16, Sweden:11, United Kingdom:AA::(theatrical rating), United Kingdom:15::(video rating), United States:R, West Germany:16","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Runtime":"102","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNjdiODgwZGYtMjI5Yi00YTMwLWI0MTEtODIyNjQ5Y2NlOTk3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"A self-centered university lecturer thinks it's quite all right that he has taken one of his students as a lover, but is deeply hurt when his wife retaliates by taking a similar approach with a visiting carpenter.

In the process, the rest of the platoon, Hulka, and Hulka's immediate superior, self-absorbed Captain Stillman, get caught unofficially behind enemy Communist lines in Czechoslovakia. John and Russell, with Stella and Louise's help, will have to show their true mettle as US army soldiers and in the process test the capabilities of the EM-50 to rescue their platoon without the rest of the US army knowing what's going on, and thus without any assistance beyond themselves.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0083131\/","Opening Date":"6\/26\/81","Closing Date":"7\/23\/81","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1981.0,"Title":"Wolfen","IMDb Title":"Wolfen","IMDb Year":"1981","Director":"Michael Wadleigh","Cast":"Albert Finney, Diane Venora, Edward James Olmos, Gregory Hines","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:M, Brazil:14, Canada:R::(Nova Scotia\/Ontario), Finland:K-16, Finland:K-18, France:Tous publics avec avertissement, India:UA::(TV), Ireland:15, Italy:VM14, Mexico:B15, Norway:15, Norway:16::(video premiere), Portugal:M\/18, Singapore:PG, Spain:16, Spain:12, Spain:13, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:18, United States:R, West Germany:16::(f)","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Runtime":"115","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNDlmZjA3ZjctMDE2OS00ZjZmLWE0MDctZjA5ZWQ0M2FkNTMzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"A city cop is assigned to solve a bizarre set of violent murders where it appears that the victims were killed by animals.

Rushed to a lifeboat with Paddy Button, the two children escape while their father (and uncle) are on another lifeboat. In the chaos following, the lifeboats are separated. Paddy, Richard and Emmeline find themselves with no food and no water stuck in the middle of nowhere. After some time, the three come across an uncharted island, where Paddy quickly teaches the children fishing, hunting and building. After maybe a month or two, Paddy gets very drunk off a barrel of rum found on the island when they first arrive, and drowns in the middle of the night. Now alone and very scared, Richard and Emmeline move location and rebuild their island home. Years later, the children grow into teenagers and have developed a very real home on their island paradise. But hormones and feelings between the two strain their friendship, until Richard, who is still very determined to reach San Francisco, is unhappy with Emmeline when a ship passes by the island and she does not light the signal fire. Throwing her out of the home they had built together, Emmeline attempts to survive on her own but is hurt after stepping on a stonefish. After Richard finds her deathly sick, he realizes how he really feels for her and manages to save her from certain doom. Nature runs its course, and their friendship turns into love as the couple learn about the facts of life, when Emmeline has a baby and does not know the reason. Then for the first time in years, a ship led by Richard's father shows up on the horizon and sees the couple playing with their baby ashore.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0080453\/","Opening Date":"8\/28\/81","Closing Date":"9\/3\/81","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1981.0,"Title":"Hell Night","IMDb Title":"Hell Night","IMDb Year":"1981","Director":"Tom DeSimone","Cast":"Linda Blair, Vincent Van Patten, Peter Barton, Kevin Brophy","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:R, Finland:K-18, Germany:Not Rated::(SPIO\/JK), Iceland:16, Netherlands:16, New Zealand:R16, Norway:18, Singapore:PG, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:18::(video rating), United Kingdom:15, United States:R, West Germany:Not Rated::(BPjM restricted)","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Runtime":"101","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BN2Y0NWQzZTUtZDlhMi00NzFlLTg4ZmYtYzRiYzczOTA0ZTIzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Before being able to join Alpha Sigma Rho fraternity and its sister sorority, four pledges must spend the night in Garth Manor, twelve years to the day after the previous resident murdered his entire family.

Jack now falls into that category. Instead of figuratively or literally breaking Jack's legs or worse, Mr. Eddie decides to take over Fine Fashions until the debt is paid, naming Jack's son Bobby Fine, an English Literature professor at upstate Chippenango State College, to manage the operations. Not only does this new career, which Bobby has no option but to accept, threaten the possibility of Bobby obtaining this year's tenure track position in the department, but Bobby at the helm of the fashion house threatens to ruin it completely, as Bobby has no idea about fashion whatsoever. Complicating matters is that Bobby and Mr. Eddie's wife, seductive Italian Lira, fall in love at first sight--she doesn't love Mr. Eddie. Bobby's association with Lira accidentally leads to the latest fashion craze which could save Fine Fashions: coined \"So Fine\", they are jeans which expose the butt cheeks, that area of the pants covered with clear plastic. With Jack and Bobby potentially coming into a financial windfall because of So Fine as well as being the toast of the fashion world, the question becomes whether Bobby will get everything he wants, including the tenure position and Lira, without Mr. Eddie killing him.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0083099\/","Opening Date":"9\/25\/81","Closing Date":"10\/15\/81","Days Played":21.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1981.0,"Title":"Tattoo","IMDb Title":"Tattoo","IMDb Year":"1981","Director":"Bob Brooks","Cast":"Bruce Dern, Maud Adams, Leonard Frey, Frederikke Borge","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:R, Finland:K-16, Norway:15::(recommended rating), Norway:16::(cinema rating), United Kingdom:X::(theatrical rating), United Kingdom:18::(video rating), United States:R, West Germany:18","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Runtime":"103","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNTIzYjQ2MTktMzI0Zi00MzI5LWIxZTUtYTlkMGY2NmFjMDJkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Karl Kinsky, an unbalanced tattoo artist, becomes dangerously obsessed with Maddy, a model he meets when he's hired to paint temporary tattoos on a group of women for a photo shoot.

Harold, the son of a Lithuanian Jew, lives a somewhat-privileged life as a student at Cambridge and uses being the fastest to overcome what he sees as the obstacles he faces in life a Jew despite that privilege. In his words to paraphrase an old adage, he is often invited to the trough, but isn't allowed to drink. His running prowess does earn him the respect of his classmates, especially his running teammates, and to some extent the school administration, if only he maintains what they consider proper gentlemanly decorum, which isn't always the case in their minds. Eric Liddell, a Scot born to Christian missionaries in China, is a devout member of the Church of Scotland who hopes to eventually return to that missionary work. He sees running as a win-win: the notoriety of being fast gives him an added outlet to spread the word of God, while he sees his speed as being a gift from God, and he wants to run to honor God and that gift. This view does not sit well with his sister Jennie, who sees his running as only taking away time from his work to God. Harold and Eric's lives intersect in national races, but it is the 100-meter track event at the 1924 Paris Olympics which the two men and their supporters most anticipate. Beyond the fact that Americans Charles Paddock and Jackson Scholz are favored in the event, the much-anticipated head-to-head between Harold and Eric could be further shadowed by other issues, especially as it affects Eric's Christian beliefs.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0082158\/","Opening Date":"2\/5\/82","Closing Date":"6\/3\/82","Days Played":119.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1982.0,"Title":"The French Lieutenant's Woman","IMDb Title":"The French Lieutenant's Woman","IMDb Year":"1981","Director":"Karel Reisz","Cast":"Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Hilton McRae, Emily Morgan","Country":"United Kingdom","Certification":"Argentina:16, Argentina:Atp, Australia:M, Belgium:KT\/EA, Brazil:14, Canada:14::(Nova Scotia), Canada:PG::(Ontario), Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Hungary:16, Iceland:12, India:U::(TV), India:A::(Bombay), Ireland:15, Italy:T, New Zealand:PG, Norway:16, Peru:14, Poland:18::(self-applied), Singapore:M18, Spain:14, Spain:13, Sweden:11, United Kingdom:AA, United Kingdom:12, United Kingdom:15::(video rating), United States:R, West Germany:12","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Runtime":"124","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMDYzZjg5NzgtYTQ0Zi00YjJkLThkYzAtNjRmZDJlYTRhMTEyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"In nineteenth century England Charles, a paleontologist, is engaged to be married, but who falls in love with outcast Sarah, whose melancholy makes her leave him after a short, but passionate affair.

In the last week of 1959, Baltimore Colts fanatic Eddie is scheduled to marry Elyse on New Year's Eve, but might call it off if she doesn't pass his Colts quiz on the 29th. Inexperienced Eddie turns to the only other married one of their bunch, electronics salesman and music aficionado Shrevie, for advice, but Shrevie might not be the best marriage advisor since he doesn't yet realize he probably married his wife Beth for the wrong reasons. Beth has lost her sense of identity, is unhappy in her marriage, and contemplates having an affair with someone who provides what she believes is a sympathetic shoulder. Hairdresser and law school student Boogie is the player of the bunch and has major financial problems because of his quest for the fast buck. Generally strait-laced Billy, Eddie's best man who has been away getting his MBA, has come back to Baltimore a few days early to clarify his relationship with his girlfriend Barbara. Smart-aleck Fen is a college dropout who lives off his trust fund and doesn't much like his family--just what their money can buy him. And insecure Modell is afraid to ask for anything directly. As 1960 approaches, they collectively deal with how to truly be adults.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0083833\/","Opening Date":"7\/9\/82","Closing Date":"8\/19\/82","Days Played":42.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1982.0,"Title":"An Officer and a Gentleman (Preview Screening)","IMDb Title":"An Officer and a Gentleman","IMDb Year":"1982","Director":"Taylor Hackford","Cast":"Richard Gere, Debra Winger, David Keith, Robert Loggia","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:M, Brazil:14::(video rating), Canada:PA::(Manitoba), Canada:R::(Nova Scotia\/Ontario), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Denmark:15, Finland:K-18, Finland:K-16, France:Unrated, France:Tous publics, Germany:16, Hong Kong:IIB, Iceland:12, India:UA, India:UA, India:A, Ireland:15, Ireland:15A::(new rating), Italy:T, Japan:R15+, Malaysia:U, Netherlands:12, Netherlands:6, New Zealand:R16, Norway:15, Peru:18, Philippines:R-13, Portugal:M\/16, Russia:16+, Singapore:M18, South Korea:18, Spain:16, Spain:12, Spain:13, Sweden:15, Taiwan:R, United Kingdom:15, United States:R, West Germany:16::(w)","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Runtime":"124","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZjhiOWY0N2MtODhmYi00YjZiLWJlYWQtZTc5NzkwYzZhYWU5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Zack Mayo is a young man who has signed up for Navy Aviation Officer Candidate School.

Seven years ago, Miss Wulla Jean died, leaving the Chicken Ranch to her favorite working girl, Miss Mona Stangley, who wants to keep the same traditions of Miss Wulla Jean. The Chicken Ranch has always had the unofficial blessing of the local authorities, who see the ranch providing an important community service, one which most in local authority have used at one time or another in their lives. In fact, Miss Mona and Lanville County Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd have been in a relationship for years, Ed Earl, who is Miss Mona's protector, albeit one with a hot temper and good ol' boy attitude that doesn't exactly match the needs of his law upholding position.

Because of his childhood, he has always tried to make meaningful emotional connections to other living creatures. That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war, his overprotective mother smothering him, and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star, he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage, when on tour, he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction, by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world, but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0084503\/","Opening Date":"9\/17\/82","Closing Date":"10\/21\/82","Days Played":35.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1982.0,"Title":"Star Trek Wrath of Khan","IMDb Title":"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan","IMDb Year":"1982","Director":"Nicholas Meyer","Cast":"William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:NRC, Australia:M, Australia:PG, Brazil:Livre, Canada:PG, Canada:PG::(Alberta), Canada:G::(British Columbia), Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Hong Kong:I, Iceland:L, India:U, Ireland:12, Ireland:12, Ireland:PG, Italy:T, Japan:G, Lithuania:V, Malaysia:U, Netherlands:12, New Zealand:PG, Nigeria:G, Norway:11, Norway:12, Peru:Apt, Poland:12::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/12, Saudi Arabia:G, Singapore:PG, South Africa:PG, South Korea:12, Spain:A, Sweden:15, Taiwan:15::(self-applied), United Kingdom:12A, United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:12::(special edition DVD), United Kingdom:12::(DVD rating), United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:PG::(video rating), United States:PG, United States:PG, United Arab Emirates:Not Rated, West Germany:12","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Runtime":"113","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOTFkZDY5NWQtMjY4Yy00OThiLTk3YjQtMDdhYTllMTI4MTdiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"It is the 23rd century.

For instance, no one can describe how the unseen assailant broke into her home. But the painful bruises in hard-to-reach parts of Carla's body don't lie.

Just after winning an important race in Mexico, Phar Lap collapses and dies; though the film never comes out and says as much, it is assumed that the horse was \"murdered\" by the gambling interests.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0086102\/","Opening Date":"1\/11\/85","Closing Date":"1\/24\/85","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1985.0,"Title":"That's Dancing","IMDb Title":"That's Dancing!","IMDb Year":"1985","Director":"Jack Haley Jr.","Cast":"Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ray Bolger, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:G, France:Tous publics, Japan:G, Portugal:M\/6, Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:U, United States:G","Genre":"Documentary, Musical","Runtime":"105","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZDliMTAyOTktZDY0Mi00ZmJkLThmOTItYTg2NjI5NWYwMTFjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"A documentary film about dancing on the screen, from it's orgins after the invention of the movie camera, over the movie musical from the late 20s, 30s, 40s 50s and 60s up to the break dance and the music videos from the 80s.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0090152\/","Opening Date":"1\/18\/85","Closing Date":"1\/31\/85","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1985.0,"Title":"The Gods Must Be Crazy","IMDb Title":"The Gods Must Be Crazy","IMDb Year":"1980","Director":"Jamie Uys","Cast":"Marius Weyers, Sandra Prinsloo, N!xau, Louw Verwey","Country":"South Africa, Botswana","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:PG, Australia:NRC, Brazil:Livre, Canada:PG::(British Columbia\/Manitoba), Canada:14::(Nova Scotia), Canada:G::(Quebec), Denmark:7, Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Iceland:L, India:18, Indonesia:17+::(self-applied), Ireland:PG, Italy:T, Mexico:A, Netherlands:12, New Zealand:PG, Norway:12, Norway:11, Poland:12::(TV rating), Portugal:M\/12, Singapore:PG, South Africa:PG::(V), South Korea:All, South Korea:12::(DVD rating), Spain:A, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:PG, United States:TV-MA::(LV), United States:PG, West Germany:12::(f)","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Runtime":"109","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMDUzNmJjOTEtMmNhZi00YTY1LTg0MTQtOTkwNjFkNjZjMDU5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"A Bushman in the Kalahari desert encounters technology for the first time--in the shape of a Coke bottle.

The adult life of David, who would eventually become King of Israel, is presented. The blessing of the Prophets, as the voice of God, is required before the King can take any major action. It is because God is annoyed with King Saul for not following his word that the Prophet Samuel, taking his cues from God, surprisingly and unexpectedly anoints David, the teenaged and youngest of Jesse's four sons, the next King. Regardless, it isn't until David's encounter with Goliath that he and many of the Israelites believe he could and should be King. Believing the anointing of David undermines his rule, King Saul, whose army is far outnumbered by those of the enemy Philistines, takes one measure after another against David and by association at the peril of his army in battles against the Philistines. These moves by Saul do not sit well with many, but especially his son Jonathan, who supports David as the next King. Over David's eventual rule as King, he will have his own issues with God and the Prophets as often ruling by his emotions rather than by God's word, especially with regard to the treatment of his eldest son Absalom, and in his relationship with Bathsheba.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0089420\/","Opening Date":"3\/29\/85","Closing Date":"4\/18\/85","Days Played":21.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1985.0,"Title":"Ladyhawke (Preview Screening)","IMDb Title":null,"IMDb Year":null,"Director":null,"Cast":null,"Country":null,"Certification":null,"Genre":null,"Runtime":null,"Poster URL":null,"Plot Outline":null,"IMDb URL":null,"Opening Date":"4\/6\/85","Closing Date":"4\/6\/85","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1985.0,"Title":"Lost in America","IMDb Title":"Lost in America","IMDb Year":"1985","Director":"Albert Brooks","Cast":"Albert Brooks, Julie Hagerty, Sylvia Farrel, Tina Kincaid","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:M, Canada:14::(Nova Scotia), Canada:PG::(Ontario), Iceland:L, Netherlands:6, New Zealand:PG, Norway:12, Peru:14, Singapore:PG, South Korea:15, Spain:A, Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:12::(video rating), United States:R, West Germany:12","Genre":"Comedy","Runtime":"91","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOTkzZTk0NjQtODBkMi00ZDUxLWFjYmQtMWVjYmE0YzFmZDY4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"David and Linda Howard are successful yuppies from LA.

There has long been an unofficial agreement that the NYPD will leave the traditionally run Chinese triad alone to manage the crime issue in the neighborhood, the triad who is the face of organized crime of Chinatown. The triad also has an unofficial agreement with the Italian mafia, still seen as the major player in organized crime in the city, to be cooperative in a win-win situation in their illegal activities. However, the Chinese youth gangs are disregarding these unofficial agreements, being another violent player in the crime scene in Chinatown, they who take a stand by killing Jackie Wong, the head of the triad. To deal with the matter, the NYPD reassign Captain Stanley White from Brooklyn to Chinatown. Stanley, of Polish heritage, is not averse to slinging slurs toward his adversaries, most of those of a racial nature. This reassignment will not help the already deteriorating marriage he has to his long suffering wife, Connie. While Stanley is supposed to target his efforts against the youth gangs, he instead decides to target his efforts against Joey Tai, Jackie's son-in-law who has taken over the triad. Stanley's actions do not sit well with his superiors who want to honor their long held tradition of leaving the triad alone. Although Joey convinced the triad elders that they needed a more vigorous leadership which he could accomplish, Joey, in reality, may have more to do with the increased violence in Chinatown than they realize, including Jackie's murder. In achieving his goal, Stanley co-opts the assistance of Herbert Kwong, a neophyte NYPD officer to go undercover to infiltrate Joey's organization, a job for which his training may make him ill-prepared. Also to further his goals, Stanley begins a love-hate relationship with Tracy Tzu, an American born ethnic Chinese reporter who works the Chinatown beat for an English language network. As Joey goes about his business and Stanley tries to bring him down, the battle between the two becomes personal, which places those around them in danger. The question becomes whether each will survive the battle, not only against each other but by their respective organizations who may not see what they're doing as maintaining what was the on the surface peace that existed in Chinatown before the current problems.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0090350\/","Opening Date":"8\/16\/85","Closing Date":"8\/29\/85","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1985.0,"Title":"Compromising Positions","IMDb Title":"Compromising Positions","IMDb Year":"1985","Director":"Frank Perry","Cast":"Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia, Edward Herrmann, Judith Ivey","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:M, Iceland:14, Iceland:16::(video rating), Sweden:11, United Kingdom:15, United States:R, West Germany:16","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Runtime":"99","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BYjhkOTVhY2ItNmU5Yi00ZTMyLThlYzQtNjEyMzhjODY5NzZjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Judith Singer is a housewife, out of the journalism business for many years.

Alec, who aspires to political life, has just shown his true colors by changing his allegiance from Democrat to Republican, which freaks out girlfriend Leslie, who he wants to marry. Budding architect Leslie, on the other hand, has an independent streak. She believes she has to make a name for herself to find out who she is before she can truly commit to another person in marriage. But Leslie and Alec have decided to live together. Because Leslie refuses to marry Alec, he believes that justifies certain behavior. Kirby, who wants to become a lawyer and who pays for his schooling by working as a waiter at their local hangout called St. Elmo's Bar, and struggling writer Kevin are currently roommates. They are on opposite extremes of the romance spectrum. Kirby has just reconnected with Dale Biberman, a slightly older woman he knew in college who is now a doctor. He is madly in love with her and will do *anything* to impress her. Kevin, on the other hand, doesn't date and states he doesn't believe in love, making his friends speculate that he's a closet homosexual who is secretly in love with Alec. Kevin will eventually open himself up to the one friend who matters the most. Billy, married with a child, is the irresponsible one of the group who would rather sleep around and play the saxophone than face the realities of being an adult with family commitments. He still lives for the memory of his fraternity glory days. Virginal and sheltered Wendy, who comes from a wealthy family, works in a low paying social services job. Her family provides for all her financial needs. She is in love with Billy, who in turn takes advantage of her adoration of him. And most are concerned about Jules, who works in a bank, lives a life of excess in all facets and doesn't have the financial means to live that lifestyle. The question for all seven becomes whether their friendship can survive adult real life.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0090060\/","Opening Date":"10\/4\/85","Closing Date":"10\/10\/85","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1985.0,"Title":"Kiss of the Spider Woman","IMDb Title":"Kiss of the Spider Woman","IMDb Year":"1985","Director":"Hector Babenco","Cast":"William Hurt, Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jos\u040b Lewgoy","Country":"Brazil, United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:M, Brazil:14, Canada:14::(Ontario), Denmark:15, Finland:K-16, Germany:16, Hungary:16, Iceland:16, Italy:T, Netherlands:12, Norway:15::(iTunes rating), Norway:16::(cinema rating), Peru:18, Portugal:M\/16, Russia:18+, Singapore:PG, South Korea:18, South Korea:Youth not allowed::(self-applied), Spain:18::(blu-ray rating), Sweden:15, United Kingdom:15, United States:R, United Arab Emirates:15+::(DVD rating)","Genre":"Drama","Runtime":"120","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTUzOTg0MDEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg1OTM2MQ@@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Luis Molina and Valentin Arregui are cell mates in a South American prison.

That need for the thrill manifests itself in his personal life by his love of base jumping. Professionally, it is demonstrated by the fact that he is sextorting a parolee named Ruth Lanier, who feeds him information in return for him not sending her back to prison for some trumped up parole violation. With his new partner John Vukovich, Chance is more determined than ever, based on recent circumstances, to nab known longtime counterfeiter Ric Masters, who is more than willing to use violence against and kill anyone who crosses him. Masters is well aware that the Secret Service is after him. Masters' operation is somewhat outwardly in disarray, with Chance being able to nab his mule, Carl Cody, in the course of moving some of the fake money, and one of his associates, a lawyer named Max Waxman, probably stealing money from him. Partly with information from Ruth, Chance is trying to find and exploit the weaknesses in Masters' operation. To accomplish his goal, Chance takes more and more unethical and illegal measures, which may be problematic for Vukovich, who comes from a family of police officers who are sworn to uphold the law.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0090180\/","Opening Date":"11\/1\/85","Closing Date":"12\/5\/85","Days Played":35.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1985.0,"Title":"Bring on Night","IMDb Title":"Bring on the Night","IMDb Year":"1985","Director":"Michael Apted","Cast":"Miles A.

Beyond his research, teaching and writing, his life is preoccupied by fencing, attending to his delusional mother, Cecelia Burgess, and navigating a relationship with Literature professor Gretchen Carlsen, she resisting his request to move in together, while he can see that she probably wants to get married instead. Because of the authenticity in locations, a Hollywood movie crew descends on the town to film a version of Michael's novel, Sweet Liberty, he proud of its historical accuracy and its accessibility to readers who may not be familiar with the American Revolution. While most in town become star struck in all that the movie means, the one noticeable exception is Michael upon discovering that the script has little to nothing to do with his book, including not being historically accurate. Screenwriter Stanley Gould, known more for being a hack, accepts Michael's assistance in rewriting the script in seeing it as his transition to the A-list, and as such being the liaison to those that matter, namely Director Bo Hodges, and stars Elliott James and Faith Healy. Bo solely wants to make a movie that caters to the lowest common denominator of the movie-going public, but Stanley knows the way to Bo is through Elliott and Faith who have more clout. Michael and Stanley may have some issue with Elliott, who likes to exemplify his hyper-masculine on-screen persona in his personal life, especially as it pertains to the opposite sex despite being married. The issue with Faith is that Michael starts to fall for her, he arguably falling for her characterization, how he depicted her in his book, rather than Faith as a fully formed human being, one shaped by being a famous Hollywood actress.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0092035\/","Opening Date":"5\/16\/86","Closing Date":"6\/19\/86","Days Played":35.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1986.0,"Title":"Cobra","IMDb Title":"Cobra","IMDb Year":"1986","Director":"George P.

Hannah, on her second marriage to a man named Elliot, a financial advisor, is the success of the family, taking a break from her acting career to raise her children. Everyone turns to her for advice, while she never talks to others about what she needs or feels. Her first husband, Mickey, is a comedy show writer and hypochondriac, who is going through a crisis as he mistakenly believes he will die soon without a clear belief, as a non-practicing Jew, of what will happen to him in the afterlife. Single Holly is the insecure flaky sister, a struggling and thus continually unemployed actress, who has just started a catering business with her actress friend April, in order to do something constructive with her life. In her own security, Hannah even set up Holly and Mickey together following her own break-up with Mickey, Holly and Mickey's sole date which arguably was the worst night in both their lives. Holly turns to Hannah for everything in her life, including money, despite feeling Hannah overly judgmental about her failures. It's during a catering job that Holly and April meet David, an architect, who seems interested in both of them. Holly's insecurities may threaten her potential relationship with David and friendship with April. Lee, who collects unemployment, is metaphorically the family's piece of clay waiting for the right artist to mold her. She has long lived with artist Frederick, who has contempt for everyone except her, and as such relies on her for whatever his connection to the outside world. This already complex collective becomes even more complex when Elliot contemplates telling Lee that he has fallen in love with her. His attraction to her is as much feeling unneeded by Hannah, who he does not want to hurt regardless of what he decides to do with respect to Lee.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0091167\/","Opening Date":"5\/29\/87","Closing Date":"6\/4\/87","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1987.0,"Title":"The Untouchables","IMDb Title":"The Untouchables","IMDb Year":"1987","Director":"Brian De Palma","Cast":"Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:M, Brazil:14, Canada:14A, Canada:14A::(Alberta), Canada:18A::(British Columbia), Canada:R::(Nova Scotia), Canada:14A::(Nova Scotia), Canada:18A::(Ontario), Denmark:15, Ecuador:Sin Calificaci\u2014n::(self-applied), Egypt:Not Rated::(self-applied), Finland:K-15, France:Tous publics, Germany:16, Hong Kong:IIB, Iceland:16, India:UA, India:UA, India:A, Ireland:15, Israel:16::(self-applied), Italy:T, Japan:PG-12, Malaysia:18, Mexico:B-15, Netherlands:16, New Zealand:M, Norway:16::(cinema rating), Norway:15::(iTunes rating), Norway:18::(video rating), Peru:18, Poland:18::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/16, Singapore:M18, South Africa:16, South Korea:18::(video rating), South Korea:15::(theatrical rating), Spain:18, Sweden:15, Taiwan:18+, Thailand:u 18+::(self-applied), Turkey:7+::(self-applied), United Kingdom:15, United States:TV-MA::(LV), United States:TV-14::(LV, TV Rating.), United States:R, Ukraine:16, United Arab Emirates:18+::(self-applied), West Germany:16","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Runtime":"119","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BYjVlNTk3NGYtOWE0OC00MDI4LThlZWItZGMwMTdmYzcwM2Y5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"After building an empire with bootleg alcohol, legendary crime boss Al Capone rules Chicago with an iron fist.

The grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he prefers something with lots of action and \"no kissing\", but he lets grandfather continue, because he doesn't want to hurt his feelings. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of \"as you wish\" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0093779\/","Opening Date":"10\/9\/87","Closing Date":"12\/10\/87","Days Played":63.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1987.0,"Title":"Empire of the Sun","IMDb Title":"Empire of the Sun","IMDb Year":"1987","Director":"Steven Spielberg","Cast":"Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, Nigel Havers","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:PG, Brazil:Livre, Canada:PG, Canada:A::(Nova Scotia), Canada:G::(Qu\u040bbec), Denmark:11::(DVD and Blu-ray rating), Ecuador:12::(self-applied), Egypt:Not Rated::(DVD rating), Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Germany:12::(DVD and Blu-ray rating), Hong Kong:IIA, Iceland:12, India:U, Ireland:12, Ireland:PG::(DVD rating), Israel:12::(self-applied), Italy:T, Japan:G, Malaysia:U, Malaysia:P13, Mexico:A, Netherlands:AL, Netherlands:12::(DVD rating), New Zealand:PG, Norway:11::(DVD rating), Norway:15, Peru:14, Philippines:PG-13, Poland:12::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/12::(Qualidade), Russia:12+, Singapore:PG, South Africa:10, South Korea:15::(DVD rating), South Korea:All, Spain:A, Sweden:11, Taiwan:GP, Thailand:G::(self-applied), Turkey:7+::(self-applied), United Kingdom:PG, United Kingdom:PG::(DVD rating), United States:TV-14::(TV rating), United States:PG, United Arab Emirates:PG-15, West Germany:12","Genre":"Drama, War","Runtime":"153","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMWY2NjdkYzEtYWZhZS00YTdhLWJhMGQtZjkxZjZkODQyYWY5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Based on J.

She has narrowed her choice to two recent acquires: Ebby Calvin LaLoosh, the wild neophyte pitcher with a wicked fastball - the pitch on which he solely relies - but can't aim, the more he thinks about it, the more erratic the pitch gets, while he doesn't appreciate anyone criticizing him or it in believing he knows best in his lack of self-awareness; and catcher Crash Davis, the veteran who has been around the minor leagues for twelve years and who was brought in solely to harness and reign in Ebby's power. While Ebby would gladly accept Annie's offer in seeing sex as an inherent part of his being, Crash, who is as philosophical in being a thinker as he is athletic, takes himself out of the running - the first player ever to do so - as, although attracted to her, does not see sex as the \"game\" she seems to treat it, especially as he knows he is nearing the end of his baseball playing career. Part of Annie's initial transformation of Ebby is to give him that nickname he sorely wants - Nuke - to match his pitches. Thus begins Annie, Crash and Nuke's three-way season-long relationship as they evolve because of it as baseball, sexual and human beings.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0094812\/","Opening Date":"7\/22\/88","Closing Date":"9\/15\/88","Days Played":56.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1988.0,"Title":"Big","IMDb Title":"Big","IMDb Year":"1988","Director":"Penny Marshall","Cast":"Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Perkins, Robert Loggia, John Heard","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:PG, Australia:M, Australia:PG, Brazil:Livre::(video rating), Canada:PG, Canada:A::(Nova Scotia), Canada:PG::(Ontario), Denmark:A, Egypt:Not Rated::(self-applied), Finland:K-7, Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Greece:K-8, Hong Kong:I, Iceland:L, India:U, Indonesia:R, Ireland:PG, Ireland:12, Israel:13::(self-applied), Italy:T, Japan:G, Malaysia:U, Mexico:16, Netherlands:AL, New Zealand:PG, Norway:7::(VOD), Norway:10::(cinema rating), Peru:Apt, Poland:12::(TV rating), Portugal:M\/6, Saudi Arabia:G, Singapore:PG, South Africa:A, South Korea:12, Spain:A, Sweden:7, Sweden:12::(Disney+ rating), Taiwan:0+, Turkey:G, United Kingdom:12A, United Kingdom:PG, United Kingdom:12::(Blu-ray), United Kingdom:12A, United States:TV-14::(L), United States:PG, Ukraine:ZA, United Arab Emirates:Not Rated::(self-applied), West Germany:6","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Runtime":"104","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNzE3ZTc2ZDgtMzQ4MS00NjEyLWJkMDYtZmMzZmY5ODJhMDdmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Josh Baskin would do anything to be big to hang out with his crush, Cynthia, at the carnival.

Thirteen year old Molly Roth, the eldest of three offspring of Gus and Diana Roth, lives a carefree life as part of the affluent white minority in South Africa. Race is a non-issue for her as although, under apartheid, the Roths largely exist among other white people like them, she feels equally comfortable around the black people in her life, such as their servants and her parents' black friends. Beyond knowing that they are busy in their work, Molly is unaware of the full extent of what her parents do, Gus a leading member of the South African Communist Party and Ruth an anti-apartheid journalist who also secretly works for the underground in support of the outlawed African National Congress. Shortly after Gus quietly escapes the country to evade probable arrest by the government - Molly believing it just a short work related trip - Molly's carefree life starts to unravel when Diana is detained for ninety days under a new law that allows such detention without ever even being charged with a criminal offense. The goal of Diana's interrogators, led by Inspector Muller, is to get her to divulge details especially of the underground, most specifically proverbial \"names\". Beyond missing her mother, Molly begins to resent the anti-apartheid work which has directly and indirectly impacted her life in a negative way, she wanting a mother, not an activist-mother. As the situation with Diana evolves, which includes someone needing to act as caregivers to Molly and her younger sisters while Diana is in detention, Molly gets a broader perspective of her situation under apartheid as she is able to see more of life just outside her protected white enclave, and as she is made aware of what Diana is trying to achieve for society in her work.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0096464\/","Opening Date":"9\/30\/88","Closing Date":"10\/6\/88","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1988.0,"Title":"Memories of Me","IMDb Title":"Memories of Me","IMDb Year":"1988","Director":"Henry Winkler","Cast":"Billy Crystal, Alan King, JoBeth Williams, Janet Carroll","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:M, Canada:PG, Canada:G::(Quebec), Iceland:L, Ireland:G, Netherlands:AL, Sweden:7, United Kingdom:15::(video), United Kingdom:12::(video), United States:PG-13, West Germany:12","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Runtime":"105","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNjg5ZGNiNDktNDZkZC00ODU4LTk4MTYtYmQ3MTIzYjViZjBiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":null,"IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0095613\/","Opening Date":"10\/7\/88","Closing Date":"10\/20\/88","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1988.0,"Title":"Bird","IMDb Title":"Bird","IMDb Year":"1988","Director":"Clint Eastwood","Cast":"Forest Whitaker, Diane Venora, Michael Zelniker, Samuel E.

However, she has nefarious plans: She wants to move the team to Miami for the warmer climate and a new stadium. To justify the move, the team must lose--and lose badly. So she assembles the worst possible team. Among these are a past-his-prime catcher with bad knees, a shrewd but past-his-prime pitcher, a young tearaway pitcher--and felon--with a 100-mph fastball but absolutely no control, a third-baseman who is too wealthy and precious to dive, a voodoo-loving slugger who can't hit a curve ball, and an energetic-but-naive lead-off hitter and base-stealer who can't keep the ball on the ground. Against the odds, and after the inevitable initial failures, they iron out some of their faults and--much to Ms. Phelps' consternation--start to win.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0097815\/","Opening Date":"4\/7\/89","Closing Date":"5\/18\/89","Days Played":42.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1989.0,"Title":"Loverboy","IMDb Title":"Loverboy","IMDb Year":"1989","Director":"Joan Micklin Silver","Cast":"Patrick Dempsey, Kate Jackson, Robert Ginty, Nancy Valen","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:M, Belgium:KT\/EA, Finland:K-10, France:Tous publics, India:A, Netherlands:AL, Singapore:PG, United Kingdom:15, United States:PG-13, West Germany:12::(f)","Genre":"Comedy","Runtime":"98","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMDIzNWRjMDYtMzlhYS00ZjBiLTk3YzItMTI4YzdhNzdiMmMwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"College sophomore Randy Bodek is unfocused. The only thing he knows is that he loves his roommate, Jenny Gordon, who feels unappreciated as other things in his life seem to take precedence over her. He hasn't even told his parents, Diane and Joe Bodek, that he is living with a female, let alone a significant other, so Jenny breaks up with him at the end of the semester. While Randy is home during the summer break, Joe, against Diane's wishes, decides not to fund Randy's college education anymore as he is flunking all his classes and hasn't yet declared a major. Not knowing what to do besides try to get back to college if only to be with Jenny, Randy gets a minimum-wage job as a pizza-delivery guy. During the course of his job, he meets Alex Barnett, a beautiful, sophisticated older woman who likes extra anchovies on her pizza. To his surprise, she seduces him, after their sexual encounter and gives him $200 to help him get back to college. Without telling him, she ends up telling her neglected, married female friends about Randy, and the pizza joint suddenly gets many more orders for pizzas with extra anchovies. Although Randy balks at the notion of being a stud for hire, he eventually goes along with it if only to pay for his college tuition and be able to return to Jenny. In the process, he finds that most of the women just want companionship, romance, and attention, which he ends up being able to provide, and which he didn't provide in a meaningful way to Jenny. There is the potential problem of anyone finding out what is happening, mainly his boss, angry jealous husbands, his parents, and most specifically Jenny, who might have other guys waiting in the wings. Meanwhile, on the eve of their 20th anniversary, his parents face their own marital problems--which Diane might feel could be solved by a $200 pizza with extra anchovies..","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0097790\/","Opening Date":"4\/28\/89","Closing Date":"5\/11\/89","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1989.0,"Title":"Dream Team","IMDb Title":"The Dream Team","IMDb Year":"1989","Director":"Howard Zieff","Cast":"Michael Keaton, Christopher Lloyd, Peter Boyle, Stephen Furst","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:M, Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Iceland:L, India:U, Netherlands:AL, Norway:12::(TV rating), Norway:10::(cinema rating), Portugal:M\/6, Singapore:PG, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:15, United States:PG-13, West Germany:12","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Runtime":"113","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNzk2YjQwOTQtNjEyYS00Y2NlLWI4YWEtM2ViMTJmM2VmYmNhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Dr. Weitzman works with patients in a sanitarium.

His wife, Barbara Sabich, has been struggling with focus on completing her Ph.D. dissertation in Mathemetics - a thus far ten year process - she who nonetheless is applying for a college teaching position. They are generally in a loving, supportive marriage, Barbara who seems to have gotten over Rusty's infidelity with his colleague Carolyn Polhemus, an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney. Carolyn is ambitious, she who, in part, used Rusty to try and climb up the ladder. Barbara will still throw the issue of Carolyn in his face whenever there are problems between the two. Rusty and Carolyn's affair is unknown to others in their personal and professional circles. Rusty is handed the most personal case of his career when his boss and mentor, Chief Prosecuting Attorney Raymond Horgan, assigns him the case to discover who killed Carolyn, her dead body found in her apartment in what looks initially to be a violent rape, with Carolyn eventually strangled and no sign of forced entry, leading to the belief her killer was whoever her lover or possibly someone she prosecuted. Raymond, who is in a difficult reelection campaign, wants a quick resolution to the investigation, as \"finding the killer\" will greatly increase his chances of getting reelected. Rusty tries to dissuade Raymond from giving him the case because of the affair of which Raymond is unaware, with Rusty eventually having no choice but to accept barring disclosure of the affair. As Rusty proceeds with the investigation, he takes steps to hide the affair largely to protect Barbara and their adolescent son, Nat Sabich. Those measures come back to bite him when they and other evidence collected by the police lead to him being charged for Carolyn's murder. Rusty hires Sandy Stern, one of his toughest adversaries in a number of previous cases. During the court proceedings, many involved do whatever they can protect their own interest regardless of the truth. Beyond Rusty being convicted or acquitted, a question thus becomes if the truth matters or if the murderer will ever be discovered.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0100404\/","Opening Date":"7\/27\/90","Closing Date":"10\/11\/90","Days Played":77.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1990.0,"Title":"Men at Work","IMDb Title":"Men at Work","IMDb Year":"1990","Director":"Emilio Estevez","Cast":"Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez, Leslie Hope, Keith David","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:M, Canada:14A::(Ontario), France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Iceland:L, Ireland:15, Portugal:M\/12, South Korea:12::(theatrical rating), South Korea:18::(video rating), Sweden:15, United Kingdom:12, United States:TV-14::(DL, TV Rating.), United States:PG-13","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Runtime":"98","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZGU3NjM5MmUtMDkwYi00NTg4LWE1MDAtYjViMTcyMWNiNTcxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Carl and James are two pleasant but unambitious garbage men.

Novelist George Sand (Judy Davis), who is known to be writing her memoirs, is causing a sensation in the literary scene not only for the quality of her writing, but because of her extreme views and manners, including blurring the lines between the sexes - she generally wearing men's clothes - and her non-belief in the sanctity of marriage after having gone through the institution once before, now preferring sexual liaisons outside of her own wedlock, with the marital status of her lovers of no concern to her. She is just coming to the end of a turbulent affair with Jean Pierre F\u040blicien Mallefille (Georges Corraface), who she is now trying to avoid in his continual pursuit of her. Despite thinking it will be a bore because of their insufferable hostess, she invites herself to a weekend gathering of some of France's greatest artistic and creative minds - many who are attending solely for a weekend of free food - at the country estate of the Duke (Anton Rodgers) and Duchess D'Antan (Dame Emma Thompson) in Angers. George's want to attend is largely to get away from Mallefille, but also to meet visiting Polish composer Fr\u040bd\u040bric Chopin (Hugh Grant), who is an acquaintance of her cohabiting friends, Hungarian pianist Franz Liszt (Julian Sands) and Countess Marie D'Agoult (Bernadette Peters). Marie largely acts as George's confidante. George has fallen in love with Chopin through his music, not even yet having met the man. George spends the weekend and beyond pursuing the sensitive and somewhat sickly Chopin, her conquest of him which may be difficult due to their fundamental differences. That conquest is made even more difficult by other guests of the Duke and Duchess: Mallefille; writer Alfred De Musset (Mandy Patinkin), another of George's former lovers; two hellions also known as her adolescent children, onto who she has passed her relaxed views of the world; and Marie, who George does not know wants to have a sexual liaison with Chopin behind Liszt's back.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0102103\/","Opening Date":"5\/31\/91","Closing Date":"6\/6\/91","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1991.0,"Title":"City Slickers","IMDb Title":"City Slickers","IMDb Year":"1991","Director":"Ron Underwood","Cast":"Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, Bruno Kirby, Patricia Wettig","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:PG, Canada:PG::(Ontario), Canada:G::(Qu\u040bbec), Denmark:7, Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Greece:K-12, Iceland:L, Ireland:15, Israel:12::(self-applied), Italy:T, Italy:BA::(TV rating), Netherlands:AL, New Zealand:PG, Norway:9::(TV rating), Norway:10::(cinema rating), Peru:14, Poland:12::(TV rating), Portugal:M\/12, Singapore:PG, South Korea:18::(video rating), South Korea:15::(theatrical rating), Spain:A, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:12, United Kingdom:12, United Kingdom:15, United States:PG-13, United Arab Emirates:PG-15::(self-applied)","Genre":"Comedy, Western","Runtime":"113","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTkwNjM2MTc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ2NjEzNA@@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Mitch is a middle-aged big-city radio-ads salesman.

The oldest offspring, Lucas, largely acted as the protector for his younger twins siblings, Tom and Savannah, in light of their dysfunctional growing up, with their shrimper father, Henry, distant and abusive if\/when he did pay them any attention, and their mother, Lila, while not doting on them most concerned about appearances and striving for social standing. Now in middle age, Savannah is a New York based poet, Tom, still living on the South Carolina coast outside of Charleston with his wife Sally and their own three doting daughters, taking a break from his high school teaching\/football coaching job, while Lucas has long since died while still standing up for himself and his beliefs. Lila, divorced and now remarried with that wealth and social standing she so long desired, receives news that Savannah is in the hospital following her most recent suicide attempt. Not wanting to face the blame directly as she suspects, she assigns Tom to go to New York to speak to Savannah's therapist, Susan Loewenstein, to provide any information of a family history nature that could help in Savannah's recovery. Tom agrees despite hating New York, and it being not a good time since he and Sally are experiencing marital problems, they both just knowing that things between them are not working, and not having been intimate in months. As Tom and Loewenstein (as he calls her) begin their sessions, Tom is slow to divulge the Wingo family problems to her. But he learns that she too is having her own family problems, with her concert violinist husband Herbert Woodruff being self absorbed and condescending, with their young adult son, Bernard, hating both largely because they were predestining his life also as a concert violinist. Tom and Loewenstein's sessions blossom into a friendship and romance, where their talks, in addition to helping Savannah, may help them both in dealing with their own life problems, of which Tom's had been long buried both figuratively and literally.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0102713\/","Opening Date":"4\/3\/92","Closing Date":"4\/9\/92","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1992.0,"Title":"Sleepwalkers","IMDb Title":"Sleepwalkers","IMDb Year":"1992","Director":"Mick Garris","Cast":"Brian Krause, M\u0409dchen Amick, Alice Krige, Jim Haynie","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:R18+, Australia:M, Brazil:18, Brazil:16, Bulgaria:D, Canada:18A::(Canadian Home Video rating), Canada:R::(Nova Scotia), Canada:16+::(Quebec), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Chile:14, Czechia:15, Denmark:15, Finland:K-18, Finland:K-16, France:16, Germany:18::(nf), Germany:16, Germany:18::(BPjM restricted), Hong Kong:IIB, Hungary:16, Iceland:16, India:A, Ireland:18, Italy:VM14, Japan:R-15, Malaysia:18SG, Mexico:B, Netherlands:16, New Zealand:M, Nigeria:15, Norway:18::(video premiere), Norway:(Banned)::(1992-2003), Peru:14, Philippines:R-18, Portugal:M\/16, Saudi Arabia:R12, Singapore:PG, South Africa:16, South Korea:15, South Korea:18, Spain:18, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:18, United States:R, Ukraine:16, United Arab Emirates:Not Rated, Vietnam:C16","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Runtime":"91","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjIwZWE3YWItMjU2MC00NDFhLWI5MDktYTNjMTYyODdmZjYxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Charles and his mother Mary move to a small Indiana town, having recently fled Bodega Bay, California after draining and killed a young girl there.

Beyond their immediate attraction, they quickly fall in love despite the differences in their outlooks. Peter emerged more than intact from a difficult childhood to have a sense of wonder about life. Conversely, Rita, who grew up in an upper middle class home in suburban Lake Forest, can't help but be scared of life in seeing the world's problems all around her, her socialist viewpoints which she has never been able to convey to her conservative parents, Dr. Marshall and Marian Boyle. After a short but intense courtship, they decide to get married in a tasteful backyard ceremony at her parents' house. It is during their honeymoon in Jamaica that Peter comes to a realization that who is with him on this honeymoon may be Rita in body, but not in soul or spirit. Upon meeting him again back in Chicago, Peter believes that the soul inhabiting Rita's body belongs to the old man who crashed their wedding, he who requested a kiss from Rita, which she obliged. The old man, into whose body Rita's soul has moved, confirms as much. Peter has to decide who he will confide in in this rather fantastical story in his effort to switch the souls back into their rightful bodies, which may not be as easy as just getting Rita and the old man proverbially in the same room. Peter also learns that time is of the essence when he learns of the old man's own story.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0105165\/","Opening Date":"7\/31\/92","Closing Date":"8\/6\/92","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1992.0,"Title":"Unforgiven","IMDb Title":"Unforgiven","IMDb Year":"1992","Director":"Clint Eastwood","Cast":"Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Argentina:18::(cable rating), Australia:M, Brazil:12, Brazil:14, Canada:14A::(Alberta), Canada:PA::(Manitoba), Canada:14::(Nova Scotia), Canada:14A::(Nova Scotia), Canada:AA::(Ontario), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Denmark:15, Ecuador:18::(self-applied), Egypt:R::(DVD rating), Finland:K-16, France:Tous publics, Germany:16, Hungary:16, Iceland:16, India:A, Ireland:18, Israel:PG, Italy:VM14, Japan:PG12::(self-applied), Mexico:B, Netherlands:12, New Zealand:M, Nigeria:15, Norway:15, Peru:18, Philippines:R-18, Poland:16::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/16, Saudi Arabia:R15, Singapore:NC-16, South Africa:16::(self-applied), South Korea:15, Spain:18::(ICAA), Sweden:15, Taiwan:6+, Thailand:u 18+::(self-applied), Turkey:18+::(self-applied), United Kingdom:15, United States:TV-14::(LV), United States:R, United Arab Emirates:16D::(self-applied)","Genre":"Drama, Western","Runtime":"130","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNmZmMzM3YWMtZjg5Yi00M2MxLTg3ZGItNGU4YjQxNDAxM2Q4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"After escaping death by the skin of her teeth, the horribly disfigured prostitute, Delilah Fitzgerald, and her appalled and equally furious co-workers summon up the courage to seek retribution in 1880s Wyoming's dangerous town of Big Whiskey.

She is also a mentally challenged young woman who requires around the clock care, as she could cause harm to herself or others. Her brother Benny Pearl, who owns and operates a garage and who is her only living relative since their parents died twelve years ago in a car accident, has made the decision that she would live at home with him, in the process sacrificing being able to have a personal life of his own. He has hired full-time housekeepers to provide that care when he isn't around. However, he has exhausted the list of housekeepers, who keep quitting because Joon is too much to handle. As such, Benny makes the decision that perhaps it would be best for all concerned if Joon were to live in a group home, something he is hesitating telling her for fear of her reaction. Into their lives comes Sam, the eccentric cousin of Benny's friend Mike, who they obtained from Mike in a losing hand of poker. Among his eccentricities, Sam has a penchant for bursting into Buster Keatonesque physical comedy routines. As Sam ultimately makes a connection with both Benny and Joon, he becomes a complicating factor in their lives as Benny evaluates Sam's fitness to handle both the good and bad of Joon.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0106387\/","Opening Date":"5\/21\/93","Closing Date":"5\/27\/93","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1993.0,"Title":"Mac","IMDb Title":"Mac and Me","IMDb Year":"1988","Director":"Stewart Raffill","Cast":"Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Ward, Tina Caspary, Lauren Stanley","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:PG, Brazil:Livre, France:Tous publics, Iceland:L, India:U, Italy:T, Japan:G, Mexico:A, Philippines:G, Portugal:M\/6, Russia:6+, Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:U, United States:TV-G, United States:PG, West Germany:6::(f)","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family, Sci-Fi","Runtime":"99","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMGU3YjE1ZGYtYmY5NC00OTU5LTk1NjktODk1OThlYjZlYzRiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":null,"IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0095560\/","Opening Date":"5\/21\/93","Closing Date":"6\/3\/93","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1993.0,"Title":"Oliver, Oliver","IMDb Title":"Oliver!","IMDb Year":"1968","Director":"Carol Reed","Cast":"Ron Moody, Shani Wallis, Oliver Reed, Harry Secombe","Country":"United Kingdom","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:G, Brazil:12, Brazil:Livre, Canada:PG::(Ontario), Czechia:U, Finland:K-8, France:Tous publics, Hong Kong:I, Iceland:L, India:U, Ireland:G, Italy:T, Lithuania:V, Malaysia:U, Mexico:A, New Zealand:G, Nigeria:G, Norway:12, Philippines:PG-13::(MTRCB), Poland:12::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/12, Russia:0+, Saudi Arabia:G, Singapore:PG, South Africa:A, South Korea:All, Spain:A\/i::(ICAA), Sweden:11, United Kingdom:U, United States:TV-G::(TV rating), United States:G, West Germany:12","Genre":"Drama, Family, Musical","Runtime":"153","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNjRhYmVlZGItYzgxMS00MzI3LTgzZjctNTcxMGRiN2E5ZGYwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Musical adaptation of Charles Dickens's classic tale of an orphan who runs away from the orphanage and hooks up with a group of boys trained to be pickpockets by an elderly mentor.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0063385\/","Opening Date":"5\/28\/93","Closing Date":"6\/17\/93","Days Played":21.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1993.0,"Title":"Stolen Children","IMDb Title":"The Stolen Children","IMDb Year":"1992","Director":"Gianni Amelio","Cast":"Enrico Lo Verso, Valentina Scalici, Giuseppe Ieracitano, Florence Darel","Country":"Italy, France, Switzerland","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:M, Finland:K-10, Germany:12, Iceland:L, Italy:T, Netherlands:AL, Singapore:NC-16, Spain:13, Sweden:11, United Kingdom:15","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Runtime":"114","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjBkZmZlNjktN2I3Mi00MDc1LTljOWMtYWE2ZDk2MDRlM2ZmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR2,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Antonio, a policeman (carabiniere), has an order to take two children (Rosetta and her brother Luciano) from Milan to Sicily to an orphanage.

Playwright David Shayne considers himself an artist, and surrounds himself with like minded people, most struggling financially as they create art for themselves, not the masses. David, however, believes the failure of his first two plays was because he gave up creative control to other people who didn't understand the material. As such, he wants to direct his just completed third play, \"God of Our Fathers\", insider scuttlebutt being that it may very well make David the toast of Broadway. With David having no directing history, David's regular producer, Julian Marx, can't find any investors,... until a single investor who will finance the entire production comes onto the scene. He is Nick Valenti, a big time mobster, with the catch being that his dimwitted girlfriend, non-actress Olive Neal, get the lead role. A hesitant David and Julian, who are able to talk Nick into them giving Olive one of the two female supporting roles instead, go along with the scheme hoping that the three other actors hired will be able to make up for any deficiencies posed by Olive. What makes Olive's situation worse for David is that Nick has placed a bodyguard named Cheech - a typical thug who kills if need be - on Olive, he a constant presence at the theater during rehearsals. David is unaware or mindfully ignorant of issues concerning the other actors. Helen Sinclair, who has the lead, is a diva of an actress, who hasn't had a hit in years. Regardless, she is slyly manipulating David to make the role more glamorous befitting her real life persona than the frigid character he has written. Gossip is that Warner Purcell, the only male among the cast, has a roller coaster of a weight problem. Currently on a low, Warner tends to eat and eat and eat when when he gets stressed. And Eden Brent, a happy-go-lucky actress, has a constant companion in her pet chihuahua, Mr. Woofulls, whose presence is a constant thorn in Helen's side. With one problem after another during rehearsals, one event seems to have the potential to turn the production around on a permanent upswing,... that is if David goes along with it, he resisting if only because it would mean that his artistic vision was wrong. Regardless, there is still the potential for something to go violently wrong with Nick solely looking out for Olive's interest, and Cheech a constant presence, he seeing and hearing everything that is happening.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0109348\/","Opening Date":"11\/4\/94","Closing Date":"12\/15\/94","Days Played":42.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1994.0,"Title":"Clerks","IMDb Title":"Clerks","IMDb Year":"1994","Director":"Kevin Smith","Cast":"Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonauer","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:MA15+, Australia:R, Australia:MA15+, Brazil:14::(video rating), Bulgaria:D, Canada:18A, Canada:14A::(Alberta), Canada:18A::(British Columbia), Canada:18A::(Canadian Home Video rating), Canada:R::(Manitoba\/Ontario), Canada:18::(Nova Scotia), Canada:16+::(Quebec), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Chile:18, Denmark:12, Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Hong Kong:III, Hungary:18, Iceland:L, India:U, India:A::(Google Play), Ireland:18, Israel:16, Italy:VM14, Japan:R18+, Maldives:18+, Mexico:B15, Netherlands:6::(self-applied), New Zealand:R16, Norway:15, Poland:16, Russia:18+, Singapore:M18, South Africa:16, South Korea:18, Spain:18::(ICAA), Sweden:Btl, United Kingdom:18, United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:18, United Kingdom:15, United States:TV-14::(DL), United States:NC-17, United States:R, United States:TV-MA::(tv rating), United Arab Emirates:Not Rated","Genre":"Comedy","Runtime":"92","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BYzcwZTU5NzMtMGIxYi00NjRhLThkYTItNjhlYWQ0MjdhYWFmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Dante Hicks is not having a good day.

As stream-of-consciousness images incessantly flow forth from the tip of his pen, biting social satire is revealed, often along with a disturbing and haunting vision of Crumb's own betes noires and inadequacies. As his acid-trip induced images flicker across our own retinas, we gain a little insight into this complex and highly creative individual.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0109508\/","Opening Date":"6\/30\/95","Closing Date":"7\/20\/95","Days Played":21.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1995.0,"Title":"Postman","IMDb Title":"The Postman","IMDb Year":"1994","Director":"Michael Radford, Massimo Troisi","Cast":"Philippe Noiret, Massimo Troisi, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, Renato Scarpa","Country":"Italy, France, Belgium","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Australia:G, Brazil:12, Chile:14, Denmark:A, Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Germany:0, Iceland:L, India:Not Rated, Ireland:PG, Italy:T, Japan:G, Netherlands:AL, Norway:A::(cinema rating), Peru:Apt, Portugal:M\/12, Singapore:PG, South Korea:15, Spain:7, Sweden:11, United Kingdom:U, United States:PG","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama, Romance","Runtime":"108","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTE1OTJkMmEtZDBmNC00ZTBiLWEwYTQtODEzNGU2OTAxZmU5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR2,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Pablo Neruda, the famous Chilean poet, is exiled to a small island for political reasons.

Every Sunday for the past year, they have hosted a dinner party, inviting a friend over to have an open-minded discussion about whatever topics are of interest. On a dark and stormy night when Pete was supposed to bring a friend for one of those dinners, he instead comes home with Zachary Cody, who rescued a stranded Pete whose car broke down. They invite Zach to stay for dinner instead of Pete's missing friend. They soon find out that Zach is among other things a racist neo-Nazi, which brings up a potentially dangerous situation for Jewish Marc and black Luke. After some physical altercations and verbal threats, Marc ends up stabbing Zach dead out of what he considers self-defense. As the friends discuss what to do about Zach, they finally come to the conclusion that in killing Zach, they have done society a service. So they ponder 'why not invite other ultra-conservatives with extreme views to dinner to do the same to them'?

Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse working in a mobile army medical unit, feels like everything she loves in life dies on her. Because of the difficulty traveling and the dangers, especially as the landscape is still heavily booby-trapped with mines, Hana volunteers to stay behind at a church to care solely for a dying semi-amnesiac patient, who is badly burned and disfigured. She agrees to catch up to the rest of the unit after he dies. All the patient remembers is that he is English, and that he is married. Their solitude is disrupted with the arrival at the church of fellow Canadian David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), part of the Intelligence Service, who is certain that he knows the patient as a man who cooperated with the Germans. Caravaggio believes that the patient's memory is largely intact, and that he is running away from his past, in part, or in its entirety. The patient does open up about his past, all surrounding his work as a cartographer in North Africa, which was interrupted by the war. He may not be running from his work as a spy for the Germans as Caravaggio believes, but rather the memory of an affair he had with married Katharine Clifton (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), the love of his life, and the memory of a promise not totally fulfilled. Hana may also test her theory of her fates with love and death as she embarks on a relationship of her own with Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh from India, whose unit has camped on the now overgrown lawn of the church. Their work entails sweeping for and defusing mines, the discovery of one such mine which had earlier saved her life.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0116209\/","Opening Date":"12\/20\/96","Closing Date":"1\/16\/97","Days Played":28.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1996.0,"Title":"Palookaville","IMDb Title":"Palookaville","IMDb Year":"1995","Director":"Alan Taylor","Cast":"William Forsythe, Vincent Gallo, Adam Trese, Gareth Williams","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:M, Germany:6, India:U, Netherlands:AL, Spain:7, United Kingdom:15, United States:R","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Runtime":"92","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMDUyYTdhOGItYmI0MS00NThjLWEyYmYtZDNlYmQ0MjlhODk3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Jerry and his two pals, Russ and Syd, are just looking for some easy money to help them break out of their nowhere lives in their nowhere town.

The plot is set against sub-texts of Sandra's desire to manage her own pub, and thus escape the estate, and of her new relationship with her hippy boyfriend Tony; and of Leah, the brassy girl next door who has been expelled from school and spends her time listening to Mama Cass records and tripping on a variety of drugs.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0115640\/","Opening Date":"1\/10\/97","Closing Date":"1\/16\/97","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1997.0,"Title":"Shine","IMDb Title":"Shine","IMDb Year":"1996","Director":"Scott Hicks","Cast":"Geoffrey Rush, Justin Braine, Sonia Todd, Chris Haywood","Country":"Australia","Certification":"Argentina:13, Australia:PG, Belgium:KT\/EA, Brazil:18::(DVD rating), Brazil:Livre::(recommended rating), Chile:14, Denmark:15, Finland:K-8, France:Tous publics, Germany:12::(bw), Iceland:L, India:Not Rated, Ireland:15, Italy:T, Japan:G, Mexico:B15, Netherlands:AL, Netherlands:12::(DVD), New Zealand:PG, Norway:11, Peru:14, Portugal:M\/12, Russia:16+, Singapore:PG, South Africa:10, South Korea:15, South Korea:12, Spain:13, Spain:12, Sweden:11, United Kingdom:12, United States:PG-13, United Arab Emirates:Not Rated","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music, Romance","Runtime":"105","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BODZlMjRmN2UtZmY1Yi00YjhjLTg4OTAtZmQxNWMwZTY5YjI4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"As a child piano prodigy, David Helfgott's musical ambitions generate friction with his overbearing father, Peter.

Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse working in a mobile army medical unit, feels like everything she loves in life dies on her. Because of the difficulty traveling and the dangers, especially as the landscape is still heavily booby-trapped with mines, Hana volunteers to stay behind at a church to care solely for a dying semi-amnesiac patient, who is badly burned and disfigured. She agrees to catch up to the rest of the unit after he dies. All the patient remembers is that he is English, and that he is married. Their solitude is disrupted with the arrival at the church of fellow Canadian David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), part of the Intelligence Service, who is certain that he knows the patient as a man who cooperated with the Germans. Caravaggio believes that the patient's memory is largely intact, and that he is running away from his past, in part, or in its entirety. The patient does open up about his past, all surrounding his work as a cartographer in North Africa, which was interrupted by the war. He may not be running from his work as a spy for the Germans as Caravaggio believes, but rather the memory of an affair he had with married Katharine Clifton (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), the love of his life, and the memory of a promise not totally fulfilled. Hana may also test her theory of her fates with love and death as she embarks on a relationship of her own with Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh from India, whose unit has camped on the now overgrown lawn of the church. Their work entails sweeping for and defusing mines, the discovery of one such mine which had earlier saved her life.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0116209\/","Opening Date":"2\/21\/97","Closing Date":"2\/27\/97","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1997.0,"Title":"I'm Not Rappaport","IMDb Title":"I'm Not Rappaport","IMDb Year":"1996","Director":"Herb Gardner","Cast":"Walter Matthau, Ossie Davis, Amy Irving, Craig T.

Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse working in a mobile army medical unit, feels like everything she loves in life dies on her. Because of the difficulty traveling and the dangers, especially as the landscape is still heavily booby-trapped with mines, Hana volunteers to stay behind at a church to care solely for a dying semi-amnesiac patient, who is badly burned and disfigured. She agrees to catch up to the rest of the unit after he dies. All the patient remembers is that he is English, and that he is married. Their solitude is disrupted with the arrival at the church of fellow Canadian David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), part of the Intelligence Service, who is certain that he knows the patient as a man who cooperated with the Germans. Caravaggio believes that the patient's memory is largely intact, and that he is running away from his past, in part, or in its entirety. The patient does open up about his past, all surrounding his work as a cartographer in North Africa, which was interrupted by the war. He may not be running from his work as a spy for the Germans as Caravaggio believes, but rather the memory of an affair he had with married Katharine Clifton (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), the love of his life, and the memory of a promise not totally fulfilled. Hana may also test her theory of her fates with love and death as she embarks on a relationship of her own with Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh from India, whose unit has camped on the now overgrown lawn of the church. Their work entails sweeping for and defusing mines, the discovery of one such mine which had earlier saved her life.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0116209\/","Opening Date":"4\/11\/97","Closing Date":"4\/17\/97","Days Played":7.0,"Company":"Belcourt Twin","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1997.0,"Title":"When We Were Kings","IMDb Title":"When We Were Kings","IMDb Year":"1996","Director":"Leon Gast","Cast":"Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Don King, James Brown","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:PG, Canada:PG::(British Columbia\/Nova Scotia), Canada:G::(Quebec), Finland:S, France:Tous publics, Germany:6::(DVD rating), Germany:12::(bw), Ireland:PG, Japan:G, Netherlands:12, Norway:7, Portugal:M\/12, Singapore:NC-16, Spain:13, United Kingdom:PG, United Kingdom:12, United States:PG","Genre":"Documentary, Sport","Runtime":"88","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ4NjU3MzI3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYyODU3MDI@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"It's 1974, Muhammad Ali is 32 and thought by many to be past his prime.

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \"blade runners\", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \"retiring\" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0083658\/","Opening Date":"11\/1\/97","Closing Date":"11\/1\/97","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"Midnight Movie","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1997.0,"Title":"Gummo","IMDb Title":"Gummo","IMDb Year":"1997","Director":"Harmony Korine","Cast":"Jacob Sewell, Nick Sutton, Lara Tosh, Jacob Reynolds","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:R, Brazil:18, Canada:18A::(Alberta), Canada:14A::(British Columbia), Canada:R::(Manitoba), Canada:18::(Nova Scotia), Canada:AA::(Ontario), Canada:16+::(Qu\u040bbec), France:16, Germany:16, Iceland:16, India:A, Japan:PG-12, Mexico:B, New Zealand:R18, Norway:18, Portugal:M\/16, South Africa:16, Spain:18, Sweden:11, Turkey:18+, United Kingdom:18, United States:R, United States:TV-MA::(new rating), United Arab Emirates:Not Rated","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Runtime":"89","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ1NjE4NTU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkwMDg3NjE@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Constructing this film through random scenes, director Harmony Korine abruptly jettisoned any sort of narrative plot, so here we go: Solomon and Tummler are two bored teenage boys who live in Xenia, Ohio.

The film, from there, chronicles the anti-social adventures these two boys have. These include sniffing glue, killing cats, having sex, riding dirtbikes, listening to black metal, and meeting a cavalcade of quirky, bizarre, and scary people. These include a man who pimps his mentally ill wife to our anti-heroes, three sisters who play with their cat and practice becoming strippers, a black midget fending off the sexual advances of a troubled man (played by the director Harmony Korine), a 12-year-old gay transvestite who is also a cat killer, Solomon's mother who seems to be the only glimpse of sanity, two foul-mouthed six-year olds, and most importantly, a nymphlike skateboarder who walks around town wearing pink rabbit ears.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0119237\/","Opening Date":"11\/7\/97","Closing Date":"11\/20\/97","Days Played":14.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1997.0,"Title":"Fast, Cheap and Out of Control","IMDb Title":"Fast, Cheap & Out of Control","IMDb Year":"1997","Director":"Errol Morris","Cast":"Dave Hoover, George Mendon\u040ca, Raymond A.

Because of his childhood, he has always tried to make meaningful emotional connections to other living creatures. That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war, his overprotective mother smothering him, and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star, he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage, when on tour, he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction, by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world, but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0084503\/","Opening Date":"5\/2\/98","Closing Date":"5\/2\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"Midnight Movie","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Frank Capra Jr. (In Person Q&A)","IMDb Title":null,"IMDb Year":null,"Director":null,"Cast":null,"Country":null,"Certification":null,"Genre":null,"Runtime":null,"Poster URL":null,"Plot Outline":null,"IMDb URL":null,"Opening Date":"5\/1\/98","Closing Date":"5\/1\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":null,"Category":"Conference","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"The Watkins Independent Filmmakers Symposium\u041a","IMDb Title":null,"IMDb Year":null,"Director":null,"Cast":null,"Country":null,"Certification":null,"Genre":null,"Runtime":null,"Poster URL":null,"Plot Outline":null,"IMDb URL":null,"Opening Date":"5\/1\/98","Closing Date":"5\/3\/98","Days Played":3.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":null,"Category":"Conference","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Mrs. Dalloway","IMDb Title":"Mrs Dalloway","IMDb Year":"1997","Director":"Marleen Gorris","Cast":"Vanessa Redgrave, Natascha McElhone, Michael Kitchen, Alan Cox","Country":"Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States","Certification":"Argentina:Atp, Brazil:Livre, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Iceland:L, Italy:T, Japan:G, Peru:14, Portugal:M\/12, Singapore:PG, South Korea:12, Spain:T, Sweden:Btl, Switzerland:7::(canton of Geneva), Switzerland:7::(canton of Vaud), United Kingdom:PG, United States:PG-13","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Runtime":"97","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOTc1NTk4MzQtODA3NC00NjBkLWIwZDUtODEzZjhmOGZkOGRjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR1,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"London, summer 1923.

In following Mulwray, Gittes witnesses some usual business dealings, such as a public meeting for construction of a new dam to create additional water supply for Los Angeles, as fresh water is vital to the growing community during the chronic drought; Mulwray opposes the dam. Eventually Gittes sees Mulwray meeting with an unknown young woman who isn't his wife. Once news of the supposed tryst between Mulwray and this woman hits the media, additional information comes to light that makes Gittes believe that Mulwray is being framed for something and that he himself is being set up. In his investigation of the issue behind Mulwray's framing and his own setup, Gittes is assisted by Mulwray's wife Evelyn, but he thinks she isn't being forthright with him. The further he gets into the investigation, the more secrets he uncovers about the Mulwrays' professional and personal dealings, including Mulwray's former business-partnership with Evelyn's father, Noah Cross.

Vitelli and the film move back and forth between the double-crossing, murderous insincerity of the gamblers and the friendships, sweetness, and even love among Vitelli, the dancers, a dancer's mother, and the club's singer, Mr. Sophistication.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0074749\/","Opening Date":"6\/26\/98","Closing Date":"7\/1\/98","Days Played":6.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"John Cassavetes Film Festival","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Taxi Driver","IMDb Title":"Taxi Driver","IMDb Year":"1976","Director":"Martin Scorsese","Cast":"Diahnne Abbott, Frank Adu, Victor Argo, Gino Ardito","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Argentina:16, Australia:R, Australia:R18+::(current rating), Brazil:14, Canada:18A::(British Columbia), Canada:R::(Manitoba), Canada:13+::(Qu\u040bbec), Canada:14+::(Qu\u040bbec), Canada:18A::(Alberta), Chile:18, Chile:14, Colombia:18, Czechia:12, Denmark:15, Ecuador:15::(self-applied), Egypt:R::(self-applied), Finland:K-16, Finland:K-18, France:16, France:12, Germany:16::(1990s), Greece:K-16, Hong Kong:IIB, Hungary:16, Iceland:16, India:A::(Bombay), Indonesia:D::(DVD rating), Indonesia:21::(self-applied), Ireland:18, Israel:18, Italy:VM14, Japan:R-15, Japan:PG12, Kuwait:18+, Mexico:C, Mexico:B15, Netherlands:16, New Zealand:R18, Norway:15::(iTunes rating), Norway:18::(video rating), Norway:18::(theatrical rating), Norway:18::(theatrical rating), Peru:18, Philippines:R-18, Poland:16::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/18, Portugal:M\/16, Russia:18+, Singapore:M18, South Africa:16, South Korea:15::(theatrical rating), South Korea:18::(video rating), Spain:18, Spain:12, Spain:13, Sweden:15, Taiwan:12+::(self-applied), Thailand:u 18+::(self-applied), Turkey:18+, United Kingdom:18, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:18, United Kingdom:18, United States:TV-MA::(TV-MA-LV), United States:R, United Arab Emirates:18+::(self-applied), West Germany:18","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Runtime":"114","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZDNhMGYwM2UtMTdlZS00MGQ1LWI2YzAtODY5YWI1MjYyNzRmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Travis Bickle is an ex-Marine and Vietnam War veteran living in New York City.

His plan is relatively simple: Two strangers each agree to kill someone the other person wants gone. For example, Guy could kill his father and he could get rid of Guy's wife Miriam, freeing him to marry Anne Morton, the beautiful daughter of a U.S. Senator. Guy dismisses it all out of hand, but Bruno goes ahead with his half of the \"bargain\" and disposes of Miriam. When Guy balks, Bruno makes it clear that he will plant evidence to implicate Guy in her murder if he doesn't get rid of his father. Guy had also made some unfortunate statements about Miriam after she had refused to divorce him. It all leads the police to believe Guy is responsible for the murder, forcing him to deal with Bruno's mad ravings.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0044079\/","Opening Date":"7\/6\/98","Closing Date":"7\/9\/98","Days Played":4.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas","IMDb Title":"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas","IMDb Year":"1998","Director":"Terry Gilliam","Cast":"Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, Tobey Maguire, Michael Lee Gogin","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Australia:R18+, Brazil:18, Canada:18A, Canada:14A::(Alberta\/British Columbia), Canada:PG::(DVD rating), Canada:R::(Manitoba\/Ontario), Canada:18::(Nova Scotia), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Chile:18, Denmark:15, Finland:K-16, France:12, Germany:16, Hungary:14, Iceland:16, Ireland:18, Israel:18::(self-applied), Italy:T, Japan:R18+::(self-applied), Malaysia:(Banned), Mexico:C, Netherlands:16, New Zealand:R18, Norway:15::(cinema rating), Philippines:R-18, Poland:18, Portugal:M\/16, Russia:16+, Russia:18+, Singapore:R21, South Africa:16, South Korea:18, Spain:18, Sweden:15, Switzerland:16::(canton of Geneva), Turkey:18+, Turkey:13+::(DVD rating), United Kingdom:18, United States:TV-14::(DLSV), United States:R, United Arab Emirates:Not Rated","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Runtime":"118","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNjFkNjdiZjUtNzUzNy00NWM5LWFlNDUtNTRiYmJiZWNiYjkwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"The big-screen version of Hunter S.

Helen uses the word \"sensitive\" to describe Carol's overall demeanor, which is almost like she walks around in a daze, rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up, it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses, such as Helen's boyfriend Michael's invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work. There, she is almost hypnotized by her solitude, which leads to her mental state deteriorating as those obsessions come to the fore. She quickly descends into madness, which ultimately also affects those that are trying to get in touch with her.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0059646\/","Opening Date":"7\/10\/98","Closing Date":"7\/12\/98","Days Played":3.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Post Coitum","IMDb Title":"After Sex","IMDb Year":"1997","Director":"Brigitte Ro\u045fan","Cast":"Brigitte Ro\u045fan, Patrick Chesnais, Boris Terral, Nils Tavernier","Country":"France","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:M, Finland:K-16, Hong Kong:IIB, New Zealand:R16, Singapore:R(A), South Korea:18, Spain:18","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Runtime":"97","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjEwNDYxNjg1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTcxMQ@@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Diane, a Parisian of 50, a book editor married with two teen children, has an affair with a twenty-something engineer.

Britons Adela Quested (Judy Davis) and her probable future mother-in-law Mrs. Moore (Peggy Ashcroft) have just arrived in Chandrapore in British India to visit Adela's unofficial betrothed, Ronny Heaslop (Nigel Havers), who works there as the city's magistrate. Adela and Mrs. Moore, who long for \"an adventure\" in experiencing all India has to offer, are dismayed to learn upon their arrival that the ruling British do not socialize, let alone associate, with the native population. Such people as the Turtons, Mr. Turton (Richard Wilson) being Ronny's superior, who openly thumb their noses at the idea in their belief that the Indians are an inferior people. They are further dismayed to see that Ronny adheres to that custom in not wanting to jeopardize his career. At the local white only club, Adela and Mrs. Moore find a like-minded Brit in the form of Richard Fielding (James Fox), the school master at government college, he who offers to organize a small, but truly inclusive, social gathering with some natives for them, unlike the large party the Turtons organize, where the natives are treated poorly, and are used more as window dressing for Adela and Mrs. Moore's benefit. In addition to Fielding's colleague, eccentric Brahmin scholar Professor Narayan Godbole (Sir Alec Guinness), Adela, and Mrs. Moore would like to invite Aziz Ahmed (Victor Banerjee), a young, widowed local physician with whom Mrs. Moore had a chance encounter. As Mrs. Moore is the first Brit who has ever treated him with kindness as she did at that encounter, Aziz is happy to attend. As Aziz wants to impress them by being what he thinks they want him to be, which is more western, he offers to organize an outing for this small collective to the Marabar Caves, which has some renown. The outing is despite Aziz never having been to the caves himself, and despite the expense to himself, that sum of money which he really can ill afford. Something that happens at the caves has the potential to bring the British-Indian bridge that has been forged within this small collective come crumbling down, that something which also threatens Aziz and Adela's lives in the process.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0087892\/","Opening Date":"8\/26\/98","Closing Date":"8\/27\/98","Days Played":2.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Grey Gardens","IMDb Title":"Grey Gardens","IMDb Year":"1975","Director":"Ellen Hovde, Albert Maysles, David Maysles, Muffie Meyer","Cast":"Edith 'Little Edie' Bouvier Beale, Edith Bouvier Beale, Brooks Hyers, Norman Vincent Peale","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:PG, Australia:NRC, Brazil:Livre, Canada:PG::(Manitoba\/Nova Scotia\/Ontario), Canada:G::(Quebec), France:Tous publics, Italy:T, Japan:Unrated, Netherlands:9, New Zealand:PG, Norway:7::(cinema rating), United Kingdom:A, United Kingdom:PG::(video), United States:PG","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy, Drama","Runtime":"95","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BN2M0NzAwOGItYjRkNy00YjU5LTk1M2EtNTdhOWI1NDY1NmU5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"The Maysles brothers pay visits to Edith Bouvier Beale, nearing 80, and her daughter Edie.

Blanche has also decided to take a break from teaching as she states the situation has frayed her nerves. Knowing nothing about Stanley or the Kowalskis' lives, Blanche is shocked to find that they live in a cramped and run down ground floor apartment - which she proceeds to beautify by putting shades over the open light bulbs to soften the lighting - and that Stanley is not the gentleman that she is used to in men. As such, Blanche and Stanley have an antagonistic relationship from the start. Blanche finds that Stanley's hyper-masculinity, which often displays itself in physical outbursts, is common, coarse and vulgar, being common which in turn is what attracted Stella to him. Beyond finding Blanche's delicate hoidy-toidy act as putting on airs, Stanley, a plant worker, believes she may really have sold Belle Reve and is withholding Stella's fair share of the proceeds from them. What further affects the relationship between the three is that Stella is in the early stage of pregnancy with her and Stanley's first child. Soon after her arrival at the Kowalskis, Blanche starts to date Mitch, one of Stanley's friends and coworkers who is a little softer around the edges than most of Stanley's friends. Mitch does not hide the fact that he is looking in general to get married because of a personal issue, he wanting Blanche ultimately to be his wife. Mitch is somewhat unaware that Blanche has somewhat controlled their courtship to put herself in the best possible light, both figuratively and literally. But in Stanley's quest to find out the truth about Belle Reve and Blanche's life in Auriol, the interrelationships between Stanley, Blanche, Stella and Mitch may be irrevocably affected, with any revelation about that life which may further destroy what's left of Blanche's already damaged mental state.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0044081\/","Opening Date":"9\/10\/98","Closing Date":"9\/10\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"The Days of Wine and Roses","IMDb Title":"Days of Wine and Roses","IMDb Year":"1962","Director":"Blake Edwards","Cast":"Jack Lemmon, Lee Remick, Charles Bickford, Jack Klugman","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:16, Australia:A, Australia:PG, Canada:PG::(Ontario), Finland:K-16, France:Tous publics, India:A, Italy:T, Japan:G, Netherlands:6, Norway:9::(recommended rating), Norway:16::(cinema rating), Spain:18, Sweden:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:PG::(video), United States:Approved, West Germany:16::(w)","Genre":"Drama","Runtime":"117","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNzNjMTc2YzEtNTM1YS00ODc3LTk0MjgtYTY3ZWIwNzdkYjI1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Joe Clay is a top-notch public-relations man.

Young adults Bonnie Parker, a waitress, and Clyde Barrow, a criminal just released from prison, are immediately attracted to what the other represents for their life when they meet by chance in West Dallas, Texas. Bonnie is fascinated with Clyde's criminal past, and his matter-of-factness and bravado in talking about it. Clyde sees in Bonnie someone sympathetic to his goals. Although attracted to each other physically, a sexual relationship between the two has obstacles. They decide to join forces to embark on a life of crime, holding up whatever establishments, primarily banks, to make money and to have fun. They don't plan on hurting anyone or killing despite wielding loaded guns. They amass a small gang of willing accomplices, including C.W. Moss, a mechanic to fix whatever cars they steal which is important especially for their getaways, and Buck Barrow, one of Clyde's older brothers. The only reluctant tag-along is Buck's nervous wife, Blanche Barrow, a preacher's daughter. The gang's life changes after the first fatal shot is fired. After that, their willingness to shoot to kill increases to protect themselves and their livelihood. Their notoriety precedes them, so much so that no matter what one's opinion is of them, most want to have some association to the Barrow gang, to help them, to be spoken in the same breath as them, or to capture and or kill them. Of the many people they encounter in their crime spree, the one who may have the most profound effect on their lives is Texas Ranger, Frank Hamer, who seeks retribution.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0061418\/","Opening Date":"9\/12\/98","Closing Date":"9\/12\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"The Color Purple","IMDb Title":"The Color Purple","IMDb Year":"1985","Director":"Steven Spielberg","Cast":"Danny Glover, Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:13, Argentina:18, Australia:PG, Brazil:14, Bulgaria:B, Canada:14A, Canada:PG::(British Columbia), Canada:A::(Nova Scotia), Canada:13+::(Qu\u040bbec), Czechia:U, Denmark:11, Egypt:Not Rated::(self-applied), Finland:K-16, Finland:K-12, France:Tous publics, Germany:12, Hong Kong:II, Hungary:12, Iceland:12, India:U::(Bombay), Ireland:15, Italy:T, Japan:G, Lithuania:N-7, Malaysia:U, Malta:U, Mexico:B, Netherlands:AL, New Zealand:PG, Nigeria:PG, Norway:11, Norway:12::(cinema rating), Peru:14, Philippines:PG-13, Poland:12, Portugal:M\/12::(Qualidade), Russia:16+, Saudi Arabia:Not Rated, Singapore:PG, South Africa:PG, South Korea:12, Spain:A, Sweden:11, Taiwan:0+, Turkey:7+, United Kingdom:15, United States:TV-PG::(DLSV, TV Rating.), United States:PG-13, United States:TV-PG, United Arab Emirates:15+::(DVD rating), Vietnam:C13, West Germany:12","Genre":"Drama","Runtime":"154","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BM2MyZjBlMGItNThkMi00YWExLThlZmUtZmI2MGM3YWE3YTY1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"This film follows the life of Celie, a young black girl growing up in the early 1900's.

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \"blade runners\", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \"retiring\" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0083658\/","Opening Date":"9\/18\/98","Closing Date":"9\/18\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"The Shining","IMDb Title":"The Shining","IMDb Year":"1980","Director":"Stanley Kubrick","Cast":"Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers","Country":"United Kingdom, United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Argentina:13, Australia:MA15+, Australia:M, Australia:MA, Brazil:16, Brazil:14, Bulgaria:D, Canada:14A::(Alberta), Canada:18A::(British Columbia), Canada:R::(Manitoba\/Ontario), Canada:R::(Nova Scotia), Canada:18+::(Quebec), Canada:14A::(Manitoba\/Ontario), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Chile:18, Denmark:15, Denmark:15::(DVD rating), Denmark:16::(video rating), Ecuador:15::(self-applied), Egypt:18+, Finland:K-18, Finland:K-16, France:12, Germany:16, Greece:K-17, Hong Kong:III, Hungary:18, Iceland:16, India:A, Indonesia:21::(self-applied), Ireland:18::(video), Ireland:15::(video), Ireland:16, Italy:VM14, Italy:T::(extended edition), Japan:R-15, Lithuania:N-16, Malaysia:U, Maldives:18+, Mexico:B, Mexico:C, Mexico:B15::(internet), Netherlands:16, New Zealand:R16, Nigeria:15, Norway:15::(VOD), Norway:18, Philippines:X, Philippines:R-16, Poland:18::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/16, Russia:18+, Russia:16+, Saudi Arabia:R15, Singapore:M18, South Africa:16::(self-applied), South Korea:(Banned), South Korea:18::(DVD rating), Spain:16, Spain:16, Spain:13, Sweden:15, Taiwan:15+, Thailand:Not Rated::(self-applied), Turkey:18+, United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:18, United States:TV-14::(LSV), United States:R, United Arab Emirates:R::(self-applied), West Germany:16","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Runtime":"146","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNmM5ZThhY2ItOGRjOS00NzZiLWEwYTItNDgyMjFkOTgxMmRiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"After landing a job as an off-season caretaker, Jack Torrance, an aspiring author and recovering alcoholic, drags his wife Wendy and gifted son Danny to snow-covered Colorado's secluded Overlook Hotel.

Harold, the son of a Lithuanian Jew, lives a somewhat-privileged life as a student at Cambridge and uses being the fastest to overcome what he sees as the obstacles he faces in life a Jew despite that privilege. In his words to paraphrase an old adage, he is often invited to the trough, but isn't allowed to drink. His running prowess does earn him the respect of his classmates, especially his running teammates, and to some extent the school administration, if only he maintains what they consider proper gentlemanly decorum, which isn't always the case in their minds. Eric Liddell, a Scot born to Christian missionaries in China, is a devout member of the Church of Scotland who hopes to eventually return to that missionary work. He sees running as a win-win: the notoriety of being fast gives him an added outlet to spread the word of God, while he sees his speed as being a gift from God, and he wants to run to honor God and that gift. This view does not sit well with his sister Jennie, who sees his running as only taking away time from his work to God. Harold and Eric's lives intersect in national races, but it is the 100-meter track event at the 1924 Paris Olympics which the two men and their supporters most anticipate. Beyond the fact that Americans Charles Paddock and Jackson Scholz are favored in the event, the much-anticipated head-to-head between Harold and Eric could be further shadowed by other issues, especially as it affects Eric's Christian beliefs.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0082158\/","Opening Date":"9\/21\/98","Closing Date":"9\/21\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Goodfellas","IMDb Title":"Goodfellas","IMDb Year":"1990","Director":"Martin Scorsese","Cast":"Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco","Country":"United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Argentina:16, Australia:R18+, Australia:MA15+::(TV rating), Brazil:16::(Netflix self-rating), Brazil:14, Canada:18A, Canada:18A::(British Columbia), Canada:PA::(Manitoba), Canada:R::(Nova Scotia), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Canada:14A::(Alberta), Canada:14A::(Ontario), Canada:18A::(Ontario), Chile:18, Colombia:15, Czechia:15, Denmark:15, Ecuador:18::(self-applied), Egypt:18+::(self-applied), Finland:K-16, France:16, Germany:16, Greece:K-16, Hong Kong:II, Hong Kong:IIB, Hungary:16, Hungary:18, Iceland:16, India:A, Indonesia:17+::(self-applied), Ireland:18, Israel:16, Italy:VM14, Japan:PG-12, Japan:R15+, Lithuania:N-16, Malaysia:18SG, Maldives:18+, Mexico:C, Netherlands:16, New Zealand:R16, Nigeria:15, Norway:18::(cinema rating), Norway:15::(iTunes rating), Peru:18, Philippines:R-18, Poland:16, Portugal:M\/16::(Qualidade), Russia:16+, Singapore:M18, South Africa:16, South Korea:18, South Korea:19::(TV rating), Spain:18, Sweden:15, Switzerland:16::(canton of Bern), Taiwan:R-15, Thailand:u 15+::(self-applied), Turkey:18+, United Kingdom:18, United States:TV-MA::(LV), United States:TV-14::(TV rating), United States:R, United Arab Emirates:18+::(self-applied), Vietnam:C18","Genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama","Runtime":"145","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BN2E5NzI2ZGMtY2VjNi00YTRjLWI1MDUtZGY5OWU1MWJjZjRjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Henry Hill might be a small time gangster, who may have taken part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito, two other gangsters who might have set their sights a bit higher.

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called \"blade runners\", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance \"retiring\" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0083658\/","Opening Date":"9\/24\/98","Closing Date":"9\/24\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":"Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary","Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"The Shining","IMDb Title":"The Shining","IMDb Year":"1980","Director":"Stanley Kubrick","Cast":"Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers","Country":"United Kingdom, United States","Certification":"Argentina:18, Argentina:13, Australia:MA15+, Australia:M, Australia:MA, Brazil:16, Brazil:14, Bulgaria:D, Canada:14A::(Alberta), Canada:18A::(British Columbia), Canada:R::(Manitoba\/Ontario), Canada:R::(Nova Scotia), Canada:18+::(Quebec), Canada:14A::(Manitoba\/Ontario), Canada:13+::(Quebec), Chile:18, Denmark:15, Denmark:15::(DVD rating), Denmark:16::(video rating), Ecuador:15::(self-applied), Egypt:18+, Finland:K-18, Finland:K-16, France:12, Germany:16, Greece:K-17, Hong Kong:III, Hungary:18, Iceland:16, India:A, Indonesia:21::(self-applied), Ireland:18::(video), Ireland:15::(video), Ireland:16, Italy:VM14, Italy:T::(extended edition), Japan:R-15, Lithuania:N-16, Malaysia:U, Maldives:18+, Mexico:B, Mexico:C, Mexico:B15::(internet), Netherlands:16, New Zealand:R16, Nigeria:15, Norway:15::(VOD), Norway:18, Philippines:X, Philippines:R-16, Poland:18::(self-applied), Portugal:M\/16, Russia:18+, Russia:16+, Saudi Arabia:R15, Singapore:M18, South Africa:16::(self-applied), South Korea:(Banned), South Korea:18::(DVD rating), Spain:16, Spain:16, Spain:13, Sweden:15, Taiwan:15+, Thailand:Not Rated::(self-applied), Turkey:18+, United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:X, United Kingdom:15, United Kingdom:18, United States:TV-14::(LSV), United States:R, United Arab Emirates:R::(self-applied), West Germany:16","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Runtime":"146","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNmM5ZThhY2ItOGRjOS00NzZiLWEwYTItNDgyMjFkOTgxMmRiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX101_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"After landing a job as an off-season caretaker, Jack Torrance, an aspiring author and recovering alcoholic, drags his wife Wendy and gifted son Danny to snow-covered Colorado's secluded Overlook Hotel.

One person who does see Captain Wiles there is spinster Ivy Gravely, who vows to keep the Captain's secret about Harry.

Over the course of the day, several revelations come to light that question if Captain Wiles actually killed Harry.

Despite masculine and athletic Victor not only not considering slight, bespectacled Thomas a friend but being quite annoying in Thomas never having had much of a filter, especially as he tells one story after another, the two will be forever tied together in Victor's father, Arnold Joseph, having saved Thomas when he was an infant from a house fire after an Independence Day party 1976 that killed Thomas' parents. That tie is also despite Arnold having left the reservation about ten years ago to live in a trailer outside of Phoenix as Victor's mother, Arlene Joseph, kicked him out due to his drinking and violent behavior. As such, Victor and Thomas view Arnold differently, Victor with anger and love, the latter due to their blood ties, and Thomas with reverence. When Victor and Arlene learn that Arnold has just died, Victor, with he and Arlene not having the money, feels somewhat forced to accept Thomas' offer to fund his trip to Phoenix to deal with Arnold's belongings and retrieve his cremated remains, Thomas' only stipulation that he be able to come along on the trip. In their concentrated time together on the road trip, including some time with Arnold's next door neighbor Suzy Song who arguably knew more about the true Arnold than anyone else, Victor and Thomas may come to some new understandings about their relationship and about their thoughts concerning Arnold.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0120321\/","Opening Date":"10\/14\/98","Closing Date":"10\/14\/98","Days Played":1.0,"Company":"Watkins Belcourt","Series":null,"Category":"Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1998.0,"Title":"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss","IMDb Title":"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss","IMDb Year":"1998","Director":"Tommy O'Haver","Cast":"Sean Hayes, Armando Valdes-Kennedy, Mr. Dan, Chad Boardman","Country":"United States","Certification":"Australia:M, France:Tous publics, Spain:13, United Kingdom:15, United States:R","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Runtime":"92","Poster URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZTliYWIzMjQtMTYyZS00YTU5LWI1MDUtYTM3ZTJlYTJhNjZlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,101,150_.jpg","Plot Outline":"Billy, a struggling young gay photographer (who likes Polaroids), tired of being the \"other man\", falls in love with Gabriel, a waiter and aspiring musician who is probably straight but possibly gay or at least curious.
