May follows her father to the front as a nurse, and when he is mortally wounded, he is brought to the hospital to which she is assigned. A camp follower, a woman, has been brought there on a charge of being a spy, and hears the dying message of Reed. He leaves his daughter to his cousin, a northern woman she has never seen, and asks her to be good to May for his sake, as the girl is alone in the world. Later when the two woman are alone with the dead, May is struck by a shell and apparently killed. The spy, seeing a chance to escape, takes the letter from May, disguising herself in the clothing of the supposed dead girl, and goes north, where she is warmly greeted by the family, who take her for a relative. May is found by the Union troops, who have captured the entrenchment, and a doctor discovers that she is not dead. Her recovery is slow, however, and before she has a chance to go north, the impostor has firmly settled herself with her cousin, who believes her implicitly. In fact she desires to see her married to her son, although he is not inclined to the union. When May arrives, shabby and pale, she is denounced as an impostor, both by her cousin and the usurper. Fortunately for May, however, the child of a neighbor has overheard the impostor offer May a sum of money to go away, and at the same time, believing herself alone, has sneeringly admitted that she is sailing under false colors, but declares that her victim cannot prove it. May is just about to be turned away a second time, despite the sympathy of John, who is half inclined to believe her story, when the boy confronts the impostor, and his evidence, together with a severe cross-examination by the indignant John, force her to confess her fraud, and leave the home where she has no right. May kisses the child who has aided her, and is grateful to the man who proved himself a friend when everyone else made haste to disown her.","IMDb URL":"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0408904\/","Opening Date":"1926-08-05","Closing Date":"1926-08-06","Days Played":2,"Company":"Hillsboro Theatre","Series":null,"Category":"Silent Film","Season":null,"Notes":null},{"Year":1926,"Title":"All Around Frying Pan","IMDb Title":"All Around Frying Pan","IMDb Year":"1925","Director":"David Kirkland","Cast":"Fred Thomson, James A.

Fran\u00e7ois grows up to be a renowned poet, an ardent patriot, and a notorious carouser who is not above criminal acts. During the revels of All Fools Day, he insults Duke Charles of Burgundy, for which King Louis XI, who is afraid of Charles, banishes Villon from Paris. In exile outside the city walls, Fran\u00e7ois looks for ways to protect France from Burgundy's plots. When Charles plans to have one of his associates marry the king's ward Charlotte, Villon successfully disrupts the engagement, but for so doing is sentenced to death.
